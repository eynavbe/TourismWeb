            "FullDescription": "<p>Whether you are looking for a bike ride in the desert, or for a more challenging way of visiting Massada, the Judean Desert has plenty to offer you. The following is only one of many possible day rides leaving from the Ein Bokek area.<br /> Remember that cycling in the desert can be strenuous. Make sure to start early in the morning, in order to avoid cycling during the hot hours of the day, and to finish your bike ride as early as possible before the dark. Take with you plenty of water and a map.</p>\r\n<p>Leave from the Ein Bokek hotel complex northbound along the waterfront of the Dead Sea. Two kilometers north, you will reach the blue marked trailhead leading west. This is the hardest part of the ride, with about a 500 meter difference in altitude. <br /> Once you make it up to the plateau, you will overlook the whole Judean desert and Dead Sea. Continue following the blue trail about 2 km from the top of the hill until you reach a green marked trail heading north. Head north on the green trail, crossing Wadi Mor and Wadi Rahaf. You can leave your bike and walk down the Rahaf dry river bed. In between the rocks, there are pools lying in the shade, getting refilled by flood water every year.</p>\r\n<p>Continue north crossing Wadi Kanaim (Zealots), named after the people that lived on Massada and refused to surrender to the Roman Empire. Once crossing the Wadi, you will pass several ruins of the Roman League Camps from the time of the siege on Massada. Three km north of the Wadi, you will reach road #3189 leading to the Roman rampart, that was built in order to allow the Roman forces climb the mountain and end the rebellion. From here you can walk up the rampart and visit the site or continue around the fortified mountain. <br /> Follow the "runners path" used for communication between the Roman Camps surrounding Massada. It will eventually lead you to the access road and back to the shore of the Dead Sea. Follow road 90 south for 15 km until returning to the hotels in Ein Bokek.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<p>"The Negev is the true test of the Israeli people", said David Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister and one of the pioneers of settlement in the Negev. Farms, kibbutzim, schools and fields cover vast areas today that were bare desert less than 60 years ago. Follow the story of the Zionist Movement, and discover a desert that blossoms.</p>\r\n<p>There are several forms of settlements in the Negev: Development towns, which were founded by the government to absorb immigration in the 50's and 60's; kibbutzim, which are communal farms founded by Zionist Movements and live off of agriculture and light industry; moshavim, which are government founded communities where every family received a plot of land to farm; and desert farms, new in the Israeli landscape, which are farms in secluded areas, built by families that live off the land and offer services from lodging to boutique wine and olive oil . The original dwellers of the area, the Bedouins, are divided between small nomadic villages and some government founded towns. Every house in the desert has a story, no better way to hear them than on your bike.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Nitsanim to Ofakim- Welcome to the Negev</strong><br />Approx. 65 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Start the day with a visit to the historical site of Nitzanim, where the kibbutz first stood before the War of Independence.

Turn south on road # 234 across the Tse'lim river bed to Kibbutz Tse'lim. Turn southeast and follow the road along the red dunes of Halutsa towards Revivim. Visit the museum commemorating the first 11 Jewish points of settlement in the Negev. These communities, founded in 1946, were built in order to determine the borders of the future Jewish state.</p>\r\n<p>From there, continue to Park Golda, and Kibbutz Mash'abe Sade. In this area you will find several desert farms (Rota, A.S.B.A, Zohar Ba'-Midbar, and Hamaria) that offer a wide selection of gourmet food lodging, and an interesting perspective of life in a secluded farm.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Mash'abe Sade Area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Mash'abe Sade to Sde-Boker-The Land of Ben Gurion.</strong><br />Approx. 40 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Head north to the Negev Junction along road # 40.

            "FullDescription": "<p>Lots of family fun and learning experiences are not the only advantages of an unforgettable trip to Israel. Just imagine your child some day saying to his or her child, "I remember coming here when I was your age." This four-day Galilee itinerary reaches for that goal.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Your first stop can be the biblical tel of Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley, less than two hours from Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. Learning becomes fun at this mound with 25 buried cities, especially at Megiddo's 9th-century BCE water tunnel. Next, head for the Beit Alfa synagogue mosaic in the eastern Jezreel. The ancients made the floor a series of pictures in stone that everyone, then and now, can relate to. A short imaginative film depicts the artists who created the floor and the elders who commissioned it. Water fun awaits you at the springs of Gan Hashlosha (Sakhne). You can then hop over to Tiberias for a fish dinner on the Kinneret Lakeside promenade. Or, if you're planning to eat meals at your accommodations, stop at the supermarket to pick up the fixings.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Upper Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Nature lovers, especially those who go for birds, should start out at the Hula Nature Reserve to enjoy the stroller and wheelchair-friendly trails and the visitor center's multi-sensory presentations "Uforia". The reserve is a world-class ornithology attraction during migration season (for updates, go to www.birds.org.il). Your next stop can be Banias, with hiking trails, a waterfall and remains of Herodian structures. The cashier will give you the English-language brochure and map and help you decide what traile to take. Then drive to the foothills of Mount Hermon and the medieval Nimrod's Castle where lots of nooks and crannies are waiting to be explored, along with a breathtaking view from the stronghold tower.</p>\r\n<p>For a less archeology and more action, spend the afternoon kayaking the Jordan River in season, or at the Manara Cliff, with its cable-car, zip line, rock-climbing wall, rappelling and mountain-slide coaster cars.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Western Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Thos who want a romantic stroll can begin the day with a visit to charming Rosh Pina, with galleries and a gift shop selling honey, spices and other regional products along the restored 19th-century street. For the younger set, the visitors' center ahs an excellent audio-visual presentation and reconstructed home. A beautiful drive will bring you to Safed, the center of Kabala, for a fascinating round of synagogue and gallery visits. The Hameiri House brings alive the story of Safed over the past 200 years with real items of daily life on display. A fun afternoon is on the agenda at nearby Bat Ya'ar, which caters to kids with pony rides, a rope-park, bowling in the nature with wooden pins and balls, and archery. The Bat Ya'ar restaurant is a great place for dinner. Then, time to turn in for your last Galilee night.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Out to the Coast.</p>\r\n<p>Today you can explore the Mediterranean Coast. Start out at Rosh Haniqra, where an exciting cable car ride takes you down to caves carved by the sea. Down the coast, you can stop at the Achziv beach, also known as "Banana Beach" (with an entrance fee and more services) or the more basic, but free, Betzet Beach. Acre is another highlight further south. You can walk on the ancient ramparts and through the market, and the kids will love the mystery of the underground Crusader-era Knights Halls. At the old prison the family can hear about the heroes of the underground that helped bring the State of Israel into being. A shorter visit to Acre or forgoing the swim will give you time for Beit She'arim and the burial caves of ancient Jewish leaders. An early dinner and walk down the restored main street of 19th-century Zichron Ya'akov is a great way to end the day.</p>",

The reserve has lovely walking trails, including a \"floating bridge\" over the wetland, and special lookout points where visitors can observe the avian wildlife.</p>\r\n<p>In the spring of 1994 another stage in the campaign to restore natural balance in the Hula Valley was completed: the re-flooding of 250 acres now known as Lake Agmon, located approximately two kilometers north of the Hula Nature Reserve. Visitors can visit the re-flooded area to appreciate nature's powers.</p>\r\n<p>While at the Hula Valley Nature reserve don't forget to stop at Oforia, a fun multimedia display that tells the story of the migratory route across the region and the millions of birds that use it.</p>\r\n<p>Continue south to Israel's largest fresh-water lake, the Sea of Galilee, for a walk along the Tiberias waterfront or a break at one of its beaches.</p>\r\n<p>Continue across the Galilee Mountains to Rosh Hanikra.

Take the cable car down to the grottos for a short stroll through the rocky passageways.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight: in the Haifa region.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Drive to the Carmel ridge via the Druze towns of Daliat El Carmel and Isfiya.

The lady buried here is sacred by other names to other faiths: to Christians, she is St. Pelagia, a fifth-century singer from Antioch who abandoned her former life to devote herself to God. To Muslims, she is Lady Raba'ah, a ninth-century religious luminary.</p>\r\n<p>Eleona (Pater Noster) – one of the first churches to be founded on the Mount of Olives in 326 CE by Queen Helene, the mother of King Constantine who was the first Christian emperor.

Princess Alice, who married into the Greek royal family, was honored as a Righteous Gentile byYad Vashem in 1994 for hiding a Jewish family when the Nazis took over Athens.</p>\r\n<p>The Tombs of ​the Kings – an old Jerusalem tradition has it that this magnificent tomb was the burial place of the kings of Judah. But it is actually that of a queen – Helene of Adiabene –who converted to Judaism and came with her family from Mesopotamia to Jerusalem, where she was highly praised for her gifts to the poor and to the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Western Wall ­ – a last remnant of the Second Temple, and as such, the holiest place in the Jewish world and a scene of fervent prayer and Bar Mitzvah celebrations (Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays).</p>\r\n<p>The Southern Wall Archaeological Park – a "still-life" of the original Herodian street, revealing Roman destruction Robinson's Arch, and where a highlight is Hulda's Gates, named after the prophetess, and by tradition a teacher, who both censured and comforted at the end of the First Temple period.</p>\r\n<p>The Davidson Visitor Center – housed in an eighth-century CE palace, where beautiful displays and a virtual-reconstruction, high-definition interactive model bring Jerusalem's history alive.</p>\r\n<p>The Bible Lands Museum Jerusalem – in this unique collection of items reflecting Egyptians, the Hittites, the Philistines, the Assyrians and others who left their mark on the region are many displays relating to women, including jewelry, figurines, a bust of "Sarah the Matriarch," a model of Esther's palace in Shushan, a Byzantine woman's decorated sarcophagus and more.​</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Jerusalem and southern environs: rooftops, matriarchs and wise women.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Ramparts​ Walk – the opportunity to see the Holy City from above, with the mountains and the modern city on the outside, and a unique slice of life on the inside.

From here, an overview of the Judean Desert, Bethlehem, and the Mountains of Moab recalls that Ruth the Moabite changed history by braving the unknown to come to Bethlehem with her mother-in-law Naomi.</p>\r\n<p>The Church of Mary's Seat – some years ago during road work here the remains came to light of the Katisma ("seat"), a church previously known only from pilgrims' literature, where tradition says the heavily pregnant Mary rested on her way to Bethlehem. It is hoped the remains, including magnificent mosaics, will someday be restored. Meanwhile, the stone seat and the form of the octagonal church around it are still visible.</p>\r\n<p>Rachel's Tomb ­– Rachel was another biblical mother-to-be on the road to Bethlehem. After she died giving birth to Benjamin, Jacob built her a monument here (Gen. 35:20). To this day, women come to Rachel's tomb to pray for fertility and safe childbirth.</p>\r\n<p>Tekoa – explore the story of the savvy Wise Woman of Tekoa (2 Sam. 14:1-21) who got David to recall his estranged son Absalom. Take in beautiful views of the Judean Desert, visit with local women leaders to discuss models of female biblical leadership, and see two unlikely arid-land endeavors: a winery and a mushroom farm.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Jerusalem: highlights of the Old City.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Jewish Quarter – including the Cardo, Jerusalem's ancient main street; the First Temple-era Hezekiah's Wall; and the Burnt Ho​use, destroyed when the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 70 CE, where a moving audiovisual presentation highlights questions of class, the place of women, and the tragic end of one ancient Jerusalem family.</p>\r\n<p>The Syriac Orthodox Church of St. Mark – over the traditional house of Mark (Acts 12:13-16), where visitors can consider the part played by the servant girl Rhoda in the story of Peter's return to the community and other "lowly" female figures in Scripture.</p>\r\n<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre ­– the most sacred ground in the Christian world, this ancient church stands over the Tomb of Jesus and the last of the Stations of the Cross.</p>\r\n<p>The Dormition Abbey – marking the site of the Assumption of Mary, with an unusual representation of Mary surrounded by a mosaic of Old Testament women.</p>\r\n<p>The Church of the Visitation in Ein Karem – study comparisons between two biblical women's praise-poems: the Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55), which Mary uttered here, and the paean Hannah recited in Shiloh when she offered her son Samuel to God's service (1 Sam. 2:1-10).</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Jerusalem and northern environs: the women behind the men.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The City of David – the most ancient part of Jerusalem, with Warren's Shaft, the "water fortress" at Gihon (1 Kings 1:38-40), the Pool of Siloam and more.

The historian Josephus notes that two women and five children survived, and visitors wonder who they were and what might have been their fate. The new​ Massada Museum reflects daily life, highlighting among its exhibits women at their many daily tasks. The combination of Massada's dramatic story with its fabulous architecture and finds has won it recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<p>Ein Gedi National Park – a walk through the oasis, where "vineyards" once grew, a metaphor in the love poetry of the Song of Songs 1:14. The remains of Ein Gedi's antiquities frame the story of Babatha, a woman of the town who fled the Romans to a cave where archaeologists found documents telling her life story.</p>\r\n<p>End the day with a dip in the Dead Sea and spa treatments.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 6</h3>\r\n<p><strong>The Negev: meeting the Matriarchs.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Be'er-Sheba – the city that Abraham founded (Gen. 21:31) when he moved here with Sarah, and where the conflict between Sarah and Hagar reached its climax (Gen. 21:9-14). The landmark we​ll outside the gate is a backdrop for the many stories about women's encounters at the well, including Rebecca (Gen. 24:13-26) Rachel (Gen. 29:9-12), the Samaritan woman (John 4:7-29), and others.

According to tradition, Job's wife, who had sold her long hair to support the family when they became destitute, was reunited with her husband here.</p>\r\n<p>Bethsaida – the home of Peter, Andrew and Philip (John 1:44; 12:21), Bethsaida is now undergoing excavation, revealing homes and a street from the Roman period, and remains of the biblical city of Geshur, including a huge gateway and a palace. David himself may have come to the throne room discovered here to ask Talmai King of Geshur for the hand of his daughter, Maacah (2 Sam. 3:3).</p>\r\n<p>Mount Arbel National Park – with an ancient story of its own and a magnificent view of the entire region, particularly old and new Magdala, the hometown of Mary Magdalene, at its foot.

In the time of the Judges, Hazor's king sent Sisera to fight against Deborah and Barak. The fate of the defeated Sisera was decided after he encountered the brave and resourceful Jael (Judges 4:18-22). Jael is mentioned in Deborah's song (Judges 5:28-30) along with Sisera's mother, waiting in vain for her son.</p>\r\n<p>Dan Nature Reserve – the capital of the northern kingdom, this fine example of a biblical city, includes \"Abraham's Gate\" and the high place of Jeroboam in a beautiful setting on the Dan River. A biblical gateway with a seat for the king and the elders is the place to recall the story of Boaz declaring before witnesses his desire to marry Ruth (Ruth 4:1-11), and the complexities of Levirate customs.</p>\r\n<p>Banias Nature Reserve – the remains of another riverbank city grace this site, the Roman Caesarea Philippi (Matt. 16:13-20). Visitors see a temple to Pan, a shrine to the wood nymph Echo, and enjoy a thundering waterfall. A number of Druze holy places are to be found in this area, including one to a righteous woman known as Sit (Lady) Sara, where the faithful come to light candles and make vows for healing and success.</p>\r\n<p>Attend a workshop with a pottery artisan for hands-on learning about one of the most important crafts of antiquity, which some scholars think may have been invented by women as they tended the family fire.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<p>Thousands of years of history come alive: peel off the layers, learn about ancient civilizations and experience Israel through its rich archaeology.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem: Views from Above and Below.</p>\r\n<p>Overview of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives:<br /> This spiritually significant mountain is also the place for a bird's-eye view of Jerusalem's topography and for understanding how it grew through the ages.</p>\r\n<p>Underground Jerusalem including: <br />The Western Wall Tunnel – the original Western Wall of Herod's Temple Mountover which Jerusalem of later eras was constructed, walking along 1,445 feet of the original, enormous 2,000-year-old Herodian stones, seeing the lofty Warren's Gate, a street and other finds, and a fascinating interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre – most of the complex over the sacred ground marking the tomb of Jesus is a complicated combination of medieval and Byzantine architecture. Deep below the surface are remains going back to a First Temple-era stone quarry and the world-famous and rarely viewed "ship inscription," probably carved by a long-ago pilgrim.</p>\r\n<p>The City of David – King David's "fortress of Zion" (2. Sam. 5:7), the ongoing excavations include a royal palace, Warren's Shaft, the "water fortress" of the Gihon (1 Kings 1:33), the Second Temple-era Pool of Siloam (John 9:7) and a 2,000-year-old street that once led up to the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Jerusalem Archaeological Park and Davidson Visitor Center – a "still-life" of the original Herodian street, revealing Roman destruction, Robinson's Arch, the Southern Wall and steps to Hulda's Gates; and the Davidson Center, in the basement of an eighth-century-CE palace with its virtual-reconstruction, high-definition interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>The Tower of David Museum – located at the Jaffa Gate inside the rooms of Jerusalem's Turkish citadel, abutting the huge tower which despite its name was constructed by Jerusalem's master-builder, Herod. Each of the many rooms features exhibits devoted to a different time-period, clarifying the capital's complex history.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem: The Jewish Quarter and Museum Treasures.</p>\r\n<p>The Jewish Quarter, including: <br />Hezekiah's Wall – part of the First Temple-era city wall built over Jerusalem's homes (Isa. 22:10) to protect the city against Assyrian invaders, and which finally fell to the Babylonians.</p>\r\n<p>The Cardo - Jerusalem's main street in the Byzantine and medieval eras, its colonnades and arched chambers now restored as a commercial center and archaeological display.</p>\r\n<p>The Herodian Mansions – restored as a living museum beneath contemporary buildings, with remnants of the fine homes, mosaics, implements of daily life and architecture of the city's wealthy class before the destruction of the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Burnt House – the basement of a Jerusalem home revealing dramatic evidence of the Katros family who probably lived and worked here, and of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. An audiovisual presentation offers a powerful version of the family's story.</p>\r\n<p>The Israel Museum – the museum's Archaeology Wing displays rare and world-famous finds from pre-historic times to the Byzantine/Talmudic era; the Shrine of the Book, houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest copies of the Old Testament ever found and the famed 1:50 Model of Second Temple Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Bible Lands Museum – a unique collection of ancient treasures mirroring the powerful cultures of Bible days including the Egyptians, the Hittites, the Philistines the Assyrians and others who left their mark on the region and in Scripture.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>The Judean Wilderness and the Dead Sea.</p>\r\n<p>Herodium – Herod the Great created this artificial mountain, which he topped with a palace-fortress. Archaeologists have also discovered, huge cisterns, a "playground" pool at the base of the mound, and hideouts for Bar Kokhba's warriors and, recently the grand, long-sought tomb of the king himself.</p>\r\n<p>Qumran National Park– the ruins on the plateau in sight of the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered are an enigma wrapped in a mystery – were they the home of the Essenes who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls, a wealthy Sadducee manor farm, or both?</p>\r\n<p>Massada National Park – Herod's magnificent fortress, with its palaces, bathhouses and ramparts was also the scene of the last stand of the Jews against the Romans in the Great Revolt, attested to by a huge Roman siege ramp and other finds. The combination of its dramatic story and its fabulous architecture and finds has won it recognition as a World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<p>The Dead Sea – a rejuvenating rinse-off of the dust of the generations in the lowest, most mineral-rich lake on earth.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>The Judean Lowlands: hands-on archaeology and the "tel" of Tel Aviv.</p>\r\n<p>Beit Govrin National Park including an Archaeological Seminars excavation of caves that once lay beneath Hellenistic dwellings; the Sidonian Cave, the Roman amphitheater; Tel Mareshah – a city fortified by King Rehoboam of Judah (2 Chron. 11:8) and more.</p>\r\n<p>Tel Aviv – Land of Israel Museum, with its exhibit of antiquities and contemporary traditional cultures, is itself located next to an ancient mound that is part of the experience – the Philistine Tel Kasila.</p>\r\n<p>The White City – an evening tour of Tel Aviv's early-20th century Bauhaus monuments that have earned recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 5</h3>\r\n<p>From the Mediterranean Coast to Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Caesarea National Park – "Queen of the Coast" – Herod's showcase city, including the amphitheater; the theater; Byzantine walls; the "bird mosaic"; the Crusader city, the aqueduct and more.</p>\r\n<p>Megiddo National Park – King Solomon's regional capital (1 Kings 9:15), Megiddo's fortifications, water system, palaces, stables and dwellings spanning thousands of years and its great biblical significance have made it a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<p>Beit She'arim National Park – Talmudic-era catacombs with huge, decorated stone sarcophagi, where sages and leaders from across the ancient world were laid to rest, are just part of the fascinating antiquities of this city, one of the places where the Sanhedrin had its headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>Acre – this medieval gem on the Mediterranean retains a 900-year-old urban plan. The capital of the Crusaders after the fall of Jerusalem, Acre's ramparts overlooking the sea, its Knights Halls, fishermen's port, Turkish Bath Museum, bazaar and mosque over a gigantic medieval water cistern have all contributed to this city's selection as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 6</h3>\r\n<p>Around the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Bet She'an National Park – the biblical mound containing remains of the city to which the Philistines brought the bodies of Saul and his three sons (1 Sam. 31:10), and capital of the Greco-Roman alliance of cities known as the Decapolis, Bet Shean boasts colonnaded streets, mosaics, temples, fountains, pools, a theater, an amphitheater and more.</p>\r\n<p>Tiberias - The present-day capital of the Sea of Galilee, built by Herod Antipas and once the headquarters of the Sanhedrin, ancient Tiberias is now undergoing excavation that will one day reveal in all their glory its market streets, colonnades, theater and more treasures. Visit the dig, as well as Hamat Tiberias National Park– the remains of a magnificent synagogue mosaic and Mount Berenice – the Anchor Church.</p>\r\n<p>Capernaum – the first of the three cities of the "evangelical triangle" (including Bethsaida and Korazim) to return from historical oblivion, with Byzantine and Roman remains of a synagogue, a church and dwellings that raise many interesting questions and illustrate New Testament stories.</p>\r\n<p>Bethsaida – excavations are underway of the Roman city that figured centrally in the ministry of Jesus, and of huge remains of the biblical city of Geshur, hometown of David's wife Maacah (2 Sam. 3:3).</p>\r\n<p>Korazim National Park – an early Talmudic-era synagogue that is interesting to compare to Capernaum's, with the replica of its original Moses Seat, a ritual bath, dwellings and other elements that bring alive Talmudic descriptions of community life.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 7</h3>\r\n<p>From Dan to the Golan.</p>\r\n<p>Dan Nature Reserve – one of the finest examples of a biblical city and the capital of the Northern Kingdom, Dan's "Abraham Gate" (Gen. 14:14) is the second-oldest arch in the world. Also visit the Israelite gateway and the High Place of Jeroboam in their tranquil Dan River setting.</p>\r\n<p>Katzrin – a Talmudic-era Golan Heights village, Katzrin's reconstructed house and synagogue create a three-dimensional perspective on ancient life.</p>\r\n<p>Gamla Nature Reserve – called "the Masada of the north" because of Josephus' description of its famous last stand, a hike leads to Gamla, which boasts remains of the earliest synagogue ever found, ramparts that held back the Romans, and olive presses that were the town's livelihood.</p>\r\n<p>Umm el-Qanatir – a Talmudic-era town with unusual synagogue remains and unique finds, this site is now undergoing excavation using cutting-edge techniques and technology.</p>",

This is only one of many possible rides in the area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Please note,</strong> cycling in the desert can be extremely strenuous, so make sure you have plenty of water, a map and that you avoid cycling during the hot hours of the day.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Begin the day at the Sde Boker School for Environmental Education. Sde Boker is a realization of Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion's vision of settling the desert. Ben Gurion is buried at the Sde Boker cemetary overlooking the desert. <br /> Leaving Sde Boker, you will head into the Tsin Valley. Four km after leaving the main road, you will reach a turnoff to a blue marked trail. Follow it into the gorge, until you reach Ein Akev, one of the largest water sources in the Negev, with a large pool of cold water you can relax in.</p>\r\n<p>Take the blue trail back out to the Tsin Valley, until you reach a green marked trail. The green trail follows the "Oil Road", a dirt road following the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline. This road will take you to the Zik and Shviv Oasis, where you will find some water and a surprising amount of vegetation for the desert. <br /> Climb up the Zik Accent (you might need to walk part of it) and follow the black marked road heading south. You will pass the Hava pools, filled every winter with flood water and sand dunes, until you reach the red marked trail. The red trail will take you towards the Mahmal ruins on the edge of the Ra​mon Crater until you reach the top of the Noah Accent. From here, you will be able to see the whole basin of this 40 km long crater, a very unique and colorful place.</p>\r\n<p>Head downhill into the crater and follow the ancient Incense Route, originating in the Far East and passing through this very place. Stop at the Be'erot Bedouin tent, where you can fill your water or step in for some tea and local folklore. It is a good idea to rest for some time in the shade before heading on (lodging is available here). <br /> The red marked trail will take you to Ein Saharonim, a small oasis and the ruins of an Inn built to host camel caravans. From Ein Sharonim, follow the green trail that will eventually lead you to road # 40 crossing the crater. Turn west and begin the long climb up to Mitspe Ramon to finish the day in this tranquil desert town.</p>",

The site is still mined today and the red rock of the region has several unique formations carved into the rock. All of these make a wonderful place for a ride, and nice way to see the region around Eilat.</p>\r\n<p>Take your bike 15 km north of Eilat to Be'er Ora. <br /> From Be'er Ora, take the service road north leading to the modern Timna mines. At the mines, enter the park and pass the Nehustan Lake and campground. <br /> Follow the road through the park leading you to the ruins of the biblical town that stood here in the time of King Solomon. Nearby, you will find the Shlomo Pillars; large natural pillars carved into the red rock.</p>\r\n<p>Further down, a dirt road will lead you to three more interesting sites. First you will pass the "Mushroom", another formation carved by water into the red rock. Further north lay the ancient mines of King Solomon and at the end of this road, you will reach a site of murals from Ancient Egyptian times. The paintings describe mining copper and the camel caravans that took the metal to the port on the Red Sea.</p>\r\n<p>Head back to the park's main road and head to the visitors center. From the visitors center, ride to road #90 and turn south. Enjoy a tail wind south towards Eilat, but beware of traffic in this area. <br /> Ten Kilometers south of Timna, turn into the Dom Palms site; these trees, commonly found only in Africa, have been growing in two locations around Eilat, and are the only trees of their kind for thousands of kilometers. From there, use the service road along road #90 which will take you all the way to the beach on the north shore of Eilat.</p>",

This route will take you through some of the most significant sites still standing today; some of them thousands of years old. <br /> We recommend doing some reading before the trip to understand the chronology of events, but even without knowing the order, this will be a fascinating ride.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 1 - Acre (Akko) to the Monfort</strong><br /> Approx 40 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Begin your first day in the crusader port city of Acre. This old city has been selected as one of 830 world heritage sites​; seven of which are in Israel. One could spend half a day to two days in the city, depending on how much you wish to see.</p>\r\n<p>From Acre, head north through the side road along the coastline, heading north to the beach town of Nahariya. Continue north on the beach until you reach the Ruins of Achziv. The port here was built by the crusaders as a half way point between Acre and Beirut, and was an active port until 1948.</p>\r\n<p>After a visit to Eli Avivi's museum and a quick dip in the Mediterranean, take your bike and continue to Kibbutz Gesher Ha' Ziv. Pass through the Kibbutz, and follow the service road leading to Nativ Ha'Shyara. From there, head north on road #70 to the Manot junction.</p>\r\n<p>At the junction itself you will find a sugar refinery from crusader times, presumed to be one of the earliest, if not the first in the world. Follow the road uphill to Manot, and the dirt track to Hila. North of the road you will see the Monfort, where you will begin the following day.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Hila-Ma'alot area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 2 - Monfort to Safet (Tzefad)</strong> <br /> Approx 40 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Start your day at Monfort overlooking the Kziv Valley. This fort was built by the crusaders to protect the road to the coast down in the valley.</p>\r\n<p>Take the dirt road leading to Ma'alot and continue on road #89 heading east. On your way you will pass the ruins in Brazit and at Horfiesh and you can take a detour to Nebi Sabalan, a sacred tomb to the Druze faith.</p>\r\n<p>Stay on road #89 to Gish, home of Joahanan, a leader of the rebellion against the Romans, where you can visit a synagogue from that period. Pass the tomb of the talmudic rabbi, Shimon Bar Yohai, and climb up to Safed. This city dates back to the Bronze Age; the fort on the top of the hill was built in the crusader period. Safed has been considered holy to the Jewish people and the city has been built and rebuilt over the course of the last 1500 years. Some say it is a form of a living archeological site. Relax your muscles and walk through the allies of this mystical city. Overnight in Safed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 3 - Tzfat to Tel Hai</strong><br />Approx 50 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Take road #886 north out of Tzfat following the scenic road to Yesha Junction, and the Koah Fort. This location was first built by the crusaders as a stronghold over the road to Lebanon. It has been a fort ever since, most recently by the British and the state of Israel. Continue north on road #886, along the border with Lebanon, which will slowly take you down towards Margaliot. At Margaliot, stop at the ruins of Hunin and follow road #9977 towards Tel Hai. This fort, built by pioneers of the second Aliya, entered history as a place of combat between Jewish and Arab forces in the time of French and British mandate. Pay a visit to the Shomer Home, commemorating the first Jewish settlers here in the turn of the last century. End the day in one of the many kibbutz hotels or zimmers in the area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 4 - Tel Hai to the Kal'at Namrud</strong><br />Approx 30 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Follow road #99 east toward the Jordan River. On your way, you will pass Tel Dan, the ruins of the city of the tribe of Dan, built before the city of David in Jerusalem. Cross the streams leading to the Jordan river and begin to climb towards the foothills of Mount Hermon until you reach the Banias. These springs are home to the temple of the Pan from the Byzantine era. From there, begin climbing road #989 toward Kal'at Namrud, one of the largest crusader fortresses still standing. After walking the walls and courtyards of the ancient fort, finish your day with a long deserved downhill ride, taking you back to the Banias. Overnight in the Banias Area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 5 - Along the River Jordan to the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret)</strong><br />Approx 50 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Follow the TAP road ( "Oil Road") south, and turn south on road #959 to Kibbutz Gonen. From there, follow road #918 crossing the Hula Valley, until you reach historical Mishmar HaYarden. Take the dirt road along the river (Jordan) which will lead you to the Atert Fort, that guards the entrance to Jordan. Continue south on the same road along the river until you reach road #8277 taking you to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Turn west and visit the Churches in Capernaum, marking the town that stood here in the times of Jesus and the Romans. Continue south along the western shore of the Kinneret to the Roman city of Tiberias. Finish the day touring the old city built on the lake shore. Walk the walls or relax at baths built by the Romans fed by a nearby hot spring. Overnight in Tiberias.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 6 - Tiberias to Belvoir</strong><br />Approx 40 Km.</p>\r\n<p>Ride south on the lakeshore road towards Dgania. Pass the Yardenit, marking the place of baptizing of Jesus. Along the river in this area, you will find many unexcavated villages from the Ottoman and pre-Israel times. Turn into Dgania, and take the back roads through Dgania to Beit Zera and Afikim. Cross the main road and take the road along the Jordan south. Stop at Naharaim, this first electrical plant in Israel, and continue south. Once reaching the main road again (#90), take it south until you reach road #717 which will take you uphill to Belvoir. Here, where the tribe of Issachar used to live, later became a stronghold of the crusader armies in the Galilee, overlooking the ancient route along the Jordan. From this site, continue west on #717 and spend the night in Moledet, Ramat Tsvi or Ein Harod.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day 7 - To Beit She'an</strong><br />Approx 35 Km.</p>\r\n<p>For the last day of the tour, head on road #71 to Beit She'an. You will pass Ein Harod, marking the story of King David's first recruit. Turn south on road #669 towards Beit Alfa, and visit the ancient synagogue near the Kibbutz. Continue towards the Sahne Park, where natural springs fill pools built in Byzantine times . A short ride will lead you to Beit She'an. After reaching the town, follow the signs to the old city. We recommend spending the rest of the day at the site which was a city built by Joshua, but has also been a city of every empire that controlled the road along the Jordan. Artifacts of Hellenistic, Roman, Mamluk, Crusader, Egyptian and Ottoman origin can all be found here.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<p>Passionate about the environment? Tour Israel's nature reserves, learn about farming in harsh conditions and visit sustainable-agriculture communities.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Beginning your tour in the north, visit the Talmudic Village of Katsrin on the Golan Heights and an organic farm, using age old traditional methods of farming and livestock management. (To visit the farm, please call 04-696-2434).</p>\r\n<p>Drive to Israel's eastern frontier, Alonei Habashan, to view the wind turbines used as an alternative source of energy.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Gamla Nature Reserve, with its host of animals and many well-preserved and dramatic remnants of the city among the first to revolt against Rome. The ruins are at the end of a hearty hour's hike, and also visible from a lookout, nearby which are also the ruins of a Byzantine village. The reserve boasts a phenomenal concentration of vultures and a beautiful waterfall.</p>\r\n<p>Proceed to the Hula Valley Nature Reserve. The reserve has lovely walking trails, including a \"floating bridge\" over the wetland, and special lookout points where visitors can observe the avian wildlife. In the spring of 1994 another stage in the campaign to restore natural balance in the Hula Valley was completed: the re-flooding of 250 acres now known as Lake Agmon, located approximately two kilometers north of the Hula Nature Reserve. Visitors can visit the re-flooded area to appreciate nature's powers. <br /> While at the Hula Valley Nature Reserve don't forget to stop at Oforia, a fun multimedia display that tells the story of the migratory route across the region and the millions of birds that use it.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Upper Galilee or the Sea of Galilee area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Start the day today at Mitspe Harashim, a small community nestled in the thick forest of Upper Galilee north of the city of Karmiel. Environmental conservation is at the heart of life at Harashim and all development is done with minimal damage to nature. Mitspe Harashim is part of the trend in Galilee and the Negev toward sustainable tourism to which Israel is committed.</p>\r\n<p>Then, it's on to Tzefat (Safed), one of the four holy cities in Israel and the home of Lurian mysticism (a branch of Jewish mysticism conceived by the 16th-century Rabbi Isaac Luria). Stroll along the lanes of the Old City and see its many synagogues, as well as its unique artist's colony.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Kibbutz Harduf. The kibbutz was established in 1982 by a group of young people and families who wanted to create a community based on the anthroposophist ideology. The kibbutz has since developed an exemplary educational system, a large organic food industry and a very special relationship with its Israeli Arab neighbors.</p>\r\n<p>Proceed to Acre, a historic walled port-city with continuous settlement beginning in the Phoenician period. The remains of the Crusader town, dating from 1104 to 1291, lie almost intact both above and below today's street level, providing an exceptional picture of the layout and structures of the capital of the medieval Crusader kingdom, along with touches of the Ottoman fortified market town Acre was during the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>\r\n<p>Explore the Knights Halls, the Al-Jazaar Mosque, the bathhouse with its multi-media display, and the new ethnic museum, built right into the rooms of the old wall.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Acre or Haifa areas.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Travel across Mount Carmel and the beautiful Beit Oren Valley down to Caesarea, Herod's port city and the Roman administrative capital in the region.

The municipal segment of the Yarkon Park in the heart of Tel Aviv is its main urban nature attraction, where you will meet Tel Avivians bike-riding, jogging, strolling and picnicking, especially in the late afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Making an early start to tour Jerusalem, begin with the City of David, the nucleus of Jerusalem, to view the new Visitors Center and Warren's Shaft. You can walk through the water of Hezekiah's Tunnel, dug 2700 years ago in order to secure the water flow for Jerusalem during the Assyrian siege, or take the "dry route" also through an ancient part of the water system.</p>\r\n<p>Enter the Old City via Dung Gate to visit the Western Wall, sacred to the Jewish People as the last remnant of the Second Temple.</p>\r\n<p>Tour the Excavations at the Southern Wall, walking on the original two thousand-year old street and climbing the ancient steps to the Temple, used by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims 2,000 years ago as they ascended to the Temple. At the Davidson Center, ensconced in the basement of an eighth-century CE palace, make arrangements to see its virtual-reconstruction, high-definition interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>Cross the valley up to the Jewish Quarter and enter the Herodian Mansions, aristocratic dwellings, possibly of priestly families who served in the Temple.

Spend the night at one of the fine hotels along the shores of the Dead Sea, or chose a simple close-to-nature overnight experience also offered in the Dead Sea area.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Dead Sea area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 7</h3>\r\n<p>Drive to Mitspe Ramon, located on the edge of a unique geological wonder. It is a phenomenon known as a Makhtesh: a huge crater developed by water erosion on top of a mountain ridge, creating a \"window\" onto the layers of rock from eons past. There are three makhteshim in Israel, which are the only formations of their kind in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Continue north along Route 40 and stop at Avdat, a city built by the Nabateans as a stop along the Incense Route they created from Petra to Gaza. The Nabateans learned to live in harmony with the desert by harvesting its meager rainfall to cultivate a host of crops. In making Avdat a World Heritage Site, UNESCO has recognized the unique contribution of the Nabateans to world culture.</p>\r\n<p>Stop to pay your respects at the tomb of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion with its magnificent view of the Wilderness of Tsin. Ben-Gurion believed in life in the desert, and when he retired became a member of nearby Kibbutz Sde Boker where the modest "hut" in which he lived is open to the public.</p>\r\n<p>Continuing north via Be'er Sheva, you are only about two hours from both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.</p>",

שש שעות, כל הסיור בהליכה רגלית.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">את הסיור נפתח במתחם התחנה הראשונה – ברחוב רמז. זה מתחם המנציח את תחנת הרכבת הראשונה לירושלים, משנת 1892. ניתן לחזור אל ההיסטוריה בעזרת המתחם שניצל לאחר מאבק של המועצה לשימור אתרי מורשת ושוחזר. כמו כן ניתן לראות במקום חלקים מהמסילה ותמונות מו העבר כשהתחנה פעלה כתחנת רכבת. כיום זהו מרכז המשמש לענייני תרבות, קולינריה ובילויים לתיירים, למטיילים ולתושבי ירושלים. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נצא מהשער הראשי של התחנה , נחצה את הכביש ונלך שמאלה ברחוב רמז, צעדים ספורים ונראה מימין לנו מספר מדרגות ושלט הקשור לגבעת התנ\"\"ך ולטבע עירוני בירושלים. מומלץ לעלות לגבעה זאת בשל הפריחה בה בסתו (מבשרי הסתו), בחורף ובאביב ובשל התצפית ממנה מזרחה לעבר גיא בן הינום , הר ציון והעיר העתיקה. גבעה זאת ממוקמת על קו פרשת המים של ירושלים, כלומר: ממנה הגשם היורד יתנקז בחלקו מזרחה אל גיא בן הינום ונחל קדרון לכיוון ים המלח וחלקו יתנקז לכיוון נחל רפאים, לשורק ולים התיכון. נרד חזרה אל רחוב רמז, ואחרי מספר צעדים נעצור בכניסה אל תיאטרון החאן. אם פתוח, כדאי להכנס ולהציץ. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">המבנה קשור ככל הנראה לתעשיית המשי שהיוונים אורתודוכסים ניסו לייצר בירושלים בסוף המאה ה-19, אולי מחסנים הקשורים לרכבת ולאחר קום המדינה היתה כאן נגריה. בימיו של טדי קולק, ראש עיריית ירושלים בעבר, נושא התרבות התפתח מאוד והיה לו כחזון. טדי קולק כינה את האזור בו נסייר \"\"ק\"\"מ של תרבות\"\" ותיאטרון החאן היה חלק מחזון זה. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נמשיך בהליכה של כדקה עד לרמזור, כאן נפנה ימינה ומיד נעלה אל עבר מבנה מימי המנדט הבריטי, מתחם הכנסיה הסקוטית בה נמצא כניסה ולובי עם שילוב מדהים של אריחים ארמנים, כנסיה סקוטית המוקדשת לסנט. אנדריוס, ובחצר גינה יפה שחלק קטן ממנה הוקדש בעבר לקבורת כלבים. כיום משמש המקום כבית הארחה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נרד חזרה, נצא מן המתחם ונכנס ימינה אל אתר הפתוח לציבור ומכונה: \"\"כתף הינום\"\" ממנו תצפית יפה מזרחה ועליו שרידי כנסיה ביזאנטית שהיתה על דרך עולי הרגל משער יפו לבית לחם. השביל הנמצא באתר מוביל אל שרידי קברים משלהי ימי בית ראשון, להם ארכיטקטורה מיוחדת ובהם נמצאו שפע של ממצאים מימי הבית הראשון (הסבר נמצא באתר).</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נצא חזרה ולמעוניינים ניתן לרדת מספר צעדים ולהכנס לביקור במרכז מורשת מנחם בגין (אתר בתשלום). בקצה רחוב זה גשר \"\"בני ברית\"\" לחציית הכביש לכיוון הסינמטק הירושלמי ומתחתיו פסל של הפסל יגאל תומרקין, אותו כינה: \"\"אנדרטת השלום\"\". ניתן להכנס מכאן לגן בלומפילד לפסל \"\"מזרקת האריות\"\". מזרקה זאת תוכננה ע\"\"י אמן גרמני בשם גרנות ראמפף והענקה כמתנה לעיר בשנת 1989.לאחר מכן ניתן לחצות את לחצות ל\"\"גן הפעמון\"\" שנחנך במלאת 200 שנה לעצמאות ארצות הברית ובמאכזו הוצב פעמון שהוא העתק של פעמון הדרור המפורסם בפילדלפיה. סיור בגן יחשוף בפניכם אטרקציות חביבות לכל בני המשפחה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נצא מהגן ונחצה חזרה את רחוב דוד המלך, בסמוך לרמזור ע\"\"י ככר פלומר נכנס אל השכונות משכנות שאננים וימין משה. נתחיל בסיור בשכונת \"\"משכנות שאננים\"\" שכונה שהוקמה ביוזמת סר משה מונטיפיורי במחצית המאה ה-19 לטובת יהודים שיצאו מהעיר העתיקה לחיים טובים יותר מחוץ לחומות.זו השכונה הראשונה שנבנתה מחוץ לחומות העיר. בשכונה ניתן לראות את טחנת הקמח המשופצת, את שחזור המרכבה בה נסע מונטיפיורי, את בתי התושבים ואת החומה שבנה סביב השכונה להגנה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">שכונה ציורית נוספת לזכר משה מונטיפיורי \"\"ימין משה\"\", נבנתה בשנות ה-90 של המאה ה-19 ומאוד מומלץ לשוטט בה להנאתכם. מתחת לשכונות הללו ניתן לראות בריכת מים ענקית שבסיסה כנראה בימי הבית השני ושופצה לאורך ההיסטוריה. זוהי \"\"בריכת הסלטן\"\" שבימי הקיץ משמשת כאכסניה למופעי תרבות שונים. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נסיים את הסיור בשכונות ברחוב דוד המלך ונמשיך לאורכו. נחלוף על פני שני מבנים מהיפים שנבנו בתקופת המנדט הבריטי בארץ ישראל: מימין- מלון המלך דוד שהיה בבעלות יהודית ונקשר גם לארועי היישוב. ממול, מבנה י.מ.ק.א. שניתן להכנס אליו, לסייר בלובי ובחזית החיצונית- זהו סיור ארכיטקטוני מרתק. ניתן גם להעפיל לתצפית ממגדל הפעמונים (העליה למגדל בתשלום). </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">בהמשך, נגיע אל צומת הרחובות דוד המלך/משה הס. מספר צעדים לאחר הצומת נרד שמאלה אל גן מרהיב בסגנון מרוקאי , חלק משימור המתחם של השכונה השניה שנבנתה מחוץ לחומות ע\"\"י יהודים ממרוקו, שכונת \"\"מחנה ישראל\"\"(במקום מוזיאון, נדרש תאום, הכניסה בתשלום). </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נמשיך ברחוב דוד המלך עד למפגשו עם רחוב אגרון, נחצה את הכביש ונלך שמאלה לאורך רחוב אגרון. מולנו המלון \"\"ווילדורף אסטוריה\"\" שנבנה על מבנה מלון פאלאס שהיה בבעלות ערבית ונבנה בימי השלטון הבריטי. נמשיך מעט עד לכניסה ל\"\"גן העצמאות\"\"(גן ממילא). נחצה את הגן, מימין שרידי בריכת מים גדולה כנראה מימי הבית השני ובצמוד, בית קברות מוסלמי. בקצה היוצא מן הגן נתחבר אל שכונת \"\"נחלת שבעה\"\", השכונה השלישית שנבנתה מחוץ לחומות. שכונה זאת ממוקמת בסמוך לרחוב יפו והיא חלק מהלב הפועם והתוסס של העיר. יש בה מסעדות, ברים, בתי קפה, חנויות ומוזיאונים מעניינים. אזור זה הוא בילוי לכמה שעות בפני עצמו.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">קצה השכונה גובל ברחוב יפו.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">חזרה לרכב אם הושאר בתחילת המסלול בתחבורה ציבורית או חצי שעה הליכה דרך יפו ורחוב המלך

תל-אביב, על פי השם שנבחר לתרגום העברי של הספר אלטנוילנד שכתב בנימין זאב הרצל, חוזה המדינה. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">הסיור באזור אחוזת בית מתאים למשפחות. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">משך הסיור כשעה וחצי.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 1: מגדל שלום מאיר (אחד העם 9). </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">מבחוץ נוכל להתרשם מגובהו - היום קשה להאמין שפעם הוא היה המגדל הכי גבוה בארץ (34 קומות) ויש אומרים גם בכל המזרח התיכון. בעבר עמד במקום המגדל מבנה הגימנסיה העברית 'הרצליה'. הגימנסיה שנוסדה ביפו הייתה בית הספר התיכון העברי הראשון בעולם ויצאו ממנה ראש ממשלה, מפקד ההגנה ועוד. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">ניכנס למבואה המערבית של המגדל בה נוכל לראות דגם של תל-אביב בשנותיה הראשונות – תוכלו לזהות בראשו את מבנה הגימנסיה. במבואה שני פסיפסים האחד של נחום גוטמן שהוריו היו ממייסדי תל-אביב, והאחר של דוד שריר. חפשו ביצירות את הפנס הראשון (הפנס המקורי ניצב כאן), את מלכת אסתר, או את הנטיעות בט\"\"ו בשבט. בקומה מעל נמצאות תערוכות מעניינות על תל-אביב ודגם גדול של מרכז העיר בשנת 2003.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נצא מהמגדל לכיוון דרום לתחנה הבאה מעבר לרחוב אחד העם.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 2: בית עקיבא אריה וייס (הרצל 2)</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">מר וייס היה המייסד של תל-אביב. עוד ביום בו הגיע עם משפחתו לארץ השתתף באספה בה הציע להקים שכונה חדשה. הוא היה זה שהוביל את הוצאת הרעיון לפועל. והיה כה מאושר עד כדי כך שרצה לקרוא לבתו – הבת הראשונה של תל-אביב אחוזת בית. אשתו העדיפה את השם אליזבת – והשם הסופי היה אחוזת בית וייס. כדאי לחפש מה הביאו מחוף הים והכניסו ללבנים שמהן נבנה הבית.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">ממול בית שעבר שימור והיה שייך לאדון פולאק. נחום גוטמן מתאר בספרו עיר קטנה ואנשים בה מעט את הכעס של וייס על כך שמול ביתו עם הפינה העגולה נבנה בית עם פינה שונה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נתקדם לכיוון דרום במורד רחוב הרצל. נמשיך בשדרות רוטשילד לכיוון מערב בסופן נפנה שמאלה לרחוב יהושע התלמי ונמשיך ימינה ברחוב ליליינבלום עד שנגיע לשני מבנים גדולים בקצה הרחוב מצד שמאל, האחד עם גג רעפים והאחר ללא גג. בשנת 1914</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 3: ראינוע עדן (ליליינבלום 4-2)</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">בשנת 1914 נפתח הראינוע הראשון בתל-אביב היה זה אולם להקרנת סרטים לפני עידן הצבע בקולנוע וללא קול ובליווי במבנה עם נגנים (במבנה עם גג הרעפים). את השם עדן, המרמז על מקום הנאה - ממש גן עדן, הציע הסופר ש' בן ציון אביו של נחום גוטמן. מאוחר יותר נבנה בצמוד אולם נוסף שהיה ללא גג כדי לראות סרטים בימי הקיץ החמים עם קצת רוח... במבנה זה הוקרן לראשונה בארץ חידוש גדול – הסרט המדבר והמזמר. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נפנה ברחוב פינס שמאלה ושוב שמאלה ברחוב יהודה הלוי עד לפינה עם רחוב הרצל שם נפנה שוב שמאלה ונמשיך לתחנה הבאה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 4: פסאג' פנסק (הרצל 16)</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">המבנה הגדול והמרשים נבנה בשנות העשרים, כאשר תל-אביב החלה לצמוח לגובה והפכה למרכז כלכלי של היישוב היהודי בארץ. הבניין נבנה בסגנון אירופי כמבנה עם מעבר שהוביל לחצר פנימית סביבה היו בכל הקומות עסקים ומשרדים. היכנסו בשער הבניין והציצו לחצר משמאלכם תראו מבנה מברזל – כאן פעלה המעלית הראשונה במבנה מסחרי בעיר. כשתצאו הסתכלו מצד שמאל ליד ארון החשמל מצוירת יד שעליה כתוב 'למעליה'.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נחצה את הכביש לתחנה הבאה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 5: מוזיאון הרצליליינבלום (הרצל 13) </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">הבניין המשומר ראשיתו כאחד מבתי אחוזת בית שצמח לגובה במשך השנים. כיום מפעיל בנק דיסקונט מוזיאון המספר בצורה חווייתית על המסחר והכלכלה בעיר ובישראל בכלל, שחזור של הסניף הראשון של הבנק ואף בנקאות עתידנית. יש לתאם מראש את הביקור (ללא תשלום).</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נמשיך ישר ברחוב הרצל עד לשדרות רוטשילד ניכנס לשדרה ונגיע לתחנה הבאה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 6: הקיוסק הראשון (רוטשילד פינת הרצל)</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">כאן היה מרכז השכונה בלב החולות בשל שני מתקנים: האחד הוא הפנס הראשון (אותו ראינו במגדל שלום) והאחר הוא המבנה המשוחזר של הקיוסק הראשון. הקיוסק שנבנה בתחילה מעץ, היה פתוח עד שעות מאוחרות בערב כיאה לעיר שתכונה לימים עיר ללא הפסקה. המוצר הידוע ביותר וכנראה האהוב ביותר שנקנה בו היה הגזוז – \"\"מים קופצים\"\" עם סירופ בטעמים שונים.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נמשיך מהקיוסק לתוך השדרה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">תחנה 7: פסלו של מאיר דיזנגוף ואנדרטת המייסדים</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">האיש הרוכב על הסוס הוא מאיר דיזנגוף מי שהנהיג את תל-אביב אחרי וייס, ונחשב אבי העיר תל-אביב וראש העירייה הראשון שלה. דיזנגוף מאד אהב סוסים ולסוסתו עליה כתב גם סיפור ילדים קרא 'מהירה'. בין השאר דיזנגוף היה רוכב על סוסתו לבדוק את הנעשה בעיר ופעם נתפס רוכב בתוך הגינה שהיתה בשדרה ושוטר מהמשטרה של תל-אביב קנס את ראש העירייה שכמובן זעם על כך מאד. דיזנגוף היה רוכב על סוס גם בתהלוכות העדלידע שהחלו בתל-אביב והיו אירוע השיא של חגיגות הפורים בעיר.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">מולכם תוכלו לגשת לאנדרטה שבה מונצחים מייסדי תל-אביב (תוכלו לחפש את השמות שהוזכרו במסלול). בצידה השני של האנדרטה אפשר לראות את נופיה של תל-אביב מחולות עם בעלי חיים, אל בתיה הראשונים של השכונה, צמיחתה בשנות השלושים (כיכר דיזנגוף הישנה והמחודשת) ועד לעיר הגדולה עם רבי הקומות.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נחזור כמה צעדים אחורנית לתחנה האחרונה.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">בית העצמאות (שדרות רוטשילד 16)</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">בבית זה שהיה ביתם של צינה ומאיר דיזנגוף, ונתרם על ידי דיזנגוף כדי שיקום בו המוזיאון לאמנות של תל-אביב, בטקס מרגש הכריז דוד בן-גוריון על הקמת מדינת ישראל, בה' באייר תש\"\"ח. </p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">מאיר דיזנגוף לא זכה לראות את הרגע אבל חזונם של מייסדי תל-אביב התגשם ובעיר העברית הראשונה קמה המדינה העברית.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">במקום מוזיאון בשנים הקרובות הוא סגור לשימור הבניין ולהקמת תצוגה חדשה (2018, הכניסה בתשלום)</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">הכותב: יוסי גולדברג</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">צילום: דנה פרידלנדר</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<p>Thousands of years of history come alive: peel off the layers, learn about ancient civilizations and experience Israel through its rich archaeology​​.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem: Views from Above and Below.</p>\r\n<p>Overview of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives:<br /> This spiritually significant mountain is also the place for a bird's-eye view of Jerusalem's topography and for understanding how it grew through the ages.</p>\r\n<p>Underground Jerusalem including: <br />The Western Wall Tunnel – the original Western Wall of Herod's Temple Mountover which Jerusalem of later eras was constructed, walking along 1,445 feet of the original, enormous 2,000-year-old Herodian stones, seeing the lofty Warren's Gate, a street and other finds, and a fascinating interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre – most of the complex over the sacred ground marking the tomb of Jesus is a complicated combination of medieval and Byzantine architecture. Deep below the surface are remains going back to a First Temple-era stone quarry and the world-famous and rarely viewed "ship inscription," probably carved by a long-ago pilgrim.</p>\r\n<p>The City of David – King David's "fortress of Zion" (2. Sam. 5:7), the ongoing excavations include a royal palace, Warren's Shaft, the "water fortress" of the Gihon (1 Kings 1:33), the Second Temple-era Pool of Siloam (John 9:7) and a 2,000-year-old street that once led up to the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Jerusalem Archaeological Park and Davidson Visitor Center – a "still-life" of the original Herodian street, revealing Roman destruction, Robinson's Arch, the Southern Wall and steps to Hulda's Gates; and the Davidson Center, in the basement of an eighth-century-CE palace with its virtual-reconstruction, high-definition interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>The Tower of David Museum – located at the Jaffa Gate inside the rooms of Jerusalem's Turkish citadel, abutting the huge tower which despite its name was constructed by Jerusalem's master-builder, Herod. Each of the many rooms features exhibits devoted to a different time-period, clarifying the capital's complex history.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem: The Jewish Quarter and Museum Treasures.</p>\r\n<p>The Jewish Quarter, including:<br /> Hezekiah's Wall – part of the First Temple-era city wall built over Jerusalem's homes (Isa. 22:10) to protect the city against Assyrian invaders, and which finally fell to the Babylonians.</p>\r\n<p>The Cardo - Jerusalem's main street in the Byzantine and medieval eras, its colonnades and arched chambers now restored as a commercial center and archaeological display.</p>\r\n<p>The Herodian Mansions – restored as a living museum beneath contemporary buildings, with remnants of the fine homes, mosaics, implements of daily life and architecture of the city's wealthy class before the destruction of the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Burnt House – the basement of a Jerusalem home revealing dramatic evidence of the Katros family who probably lived and worked here, and of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. An audiovisual presentation offers a powerful version of the family's story.</p>\r\n<p>The Israel Museum – the museum's Archaeology Wing displays rare and world-famous finds from pre-historic times to the Byzantine/Talmudic era; the Shrine of the Book, houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest copies of the Old Testament ever found and the famed 1:50 Model of Second Temple Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Bible Lands Museum – a unique collection of ancient treasures mirroring the powerful cultures of Bible days including the Egyptians, the Hittites, the Philistines the Assyrians and others who left their mark on the region and in Scripture.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem and environs: Monarchs, Matriarchs and Tombs.</p>\r\n<p>Herodium– Herod the Great created this artificial mountain, which he topped with a palace-fortress. Archaeologists have also discovered, huge cisterns, a "playground" pool at the base of the mound, and hideouts for Bar Kokhba's warriors and, recently the grand, long-sought tomb of the king himself.</p>\r\n<p>The Rockefeller Museum – an architectural monument in its own right, this grand 1930s-era complex houses finds from some of the great early excavations – Gezer, Megiddo, Jericho, Jerusalem and many others.</p>\r\n<p>The Kidron Valley – Jerusalem's famed Mount of Olives cemetery began here over 2,000 years ago, when the monumental tombs of Absalom, Zechariah and the Sons of Hezir were built, some of the finest examples of Hellenistic tomb architecture in the world.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Qumran National Park– the ruins on the plateau in sight of the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered are an enigma wrapped in a mystery – were they the home of the Essenes who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls, a wealthy Sadducee manor farm, or both?</p>\r\n<p>Massada National Park – Herod's magnificent fortress, with its palaces, bathhouses and ramparts was also the scene of the last stand of the Jews against the Romans in the Great Revolt, attested to by a huge Roman siege ramp and other finds. The combination of its dramatic story and its fabulous architecture and finds has won it recognition as a World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<p>Ein Gedi National Park – a walk through an oasis, and the remains of a thriving Talmudic town. Its synagogue mosaic bears a mysterious warning not to reveal "the secret"– perhaps the manufacturing process of perfume from the now-extinct balsam plant that once grew here.</p>\r\n<p>The Dead Sea – a rejuvenating rinse-off of the dust of the generations in the lowest, most mineral-rich lake on earth.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 5</h3>\r\n<p>The Judean Lowlands: hands-on archaeology and the "tel" of Tel Aviv.</p>\r\n<p>Beit Govrin National Park including an Archaeological Seminars excavation of caves that once lay beneath Hellenistic dwellings; the Sidonian Cave, the Roman amphitheater; Tel Mareshah – a city fortified by King Rehoboam of Judah (2 Chron. 11:8) and more.</p>\r\n<p>Tel Aviv – Land of Israel Museum, with its exhibit of antiquities and contemporary traditional cultures, is itself located next to an ancient mound that is part of the experience – the Philistine Tel Kasila.</p>\r\n<p>The White City – an evening tour of Tel Aviv's early-20th century Bauhaus monuments that have earned recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 6</h3>\r\n<p>From the Mediterranean Coast to Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Caesarea National Park – "Queen of the Coast" – Herod's showcase city, including the amphitheater; the theater; Byzantine walls; the "bird mosaic"; the Crusader city, the aqueduct and more.</p>\r\n<p>Megiddo National Park – King Solomon's regional capital (1 Kings 9:15), Megiddo's fortifications, water system, palaces, stables and dwellings spanning thousands of years and its great biblical significance have made it a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<p>Beit She'arim National Park – Talmudic-era catacombs with huge, decorated stone sarcophagi, where sages and leaders from across the ancient world were laid to rest, are just part of the fascinating antiquities of this city, one of the places where the Sanhedrin had its headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>Acre – this medieval gem on the Mediterranean retains a 900-year-old urban plan. The capital of the Crusaders after the fall of Jerusalem, Acre's ramparts overlooking the sea, its Knights Halls, fishermen's port, Turkish Bath Museum, bazaar and mosque over a gigantic medieval water cistern have all contributed to this city's selection as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 7</h3>\r\n<p>Around the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Beit She'an National Park – the biblical mound containing remains of the city to which the Philistines brought the bodies of Saul and his three sons (1 Sam. 31:10), and capital of the Greco-Roman alliance of cities known as the Decapolis, Bet Shean boasts colonnaded streets, mosaics, temples, fountains, pools, a theater, an amphitheater and more.</p>\r\n<p>Tiberias – The present-day capital of the Sea of Galilee, built by Herod Antipas and once the headquarters of the Sanhedrin, ancient Tiberias is now undergoing excavation that will one day reveal in all their glory its market streets, colonnades, theater and more treasures.</p>\r\n<p>Visit the dig, as well as Hamat Tiberias National Park – the remains of a magnificent synagogue mosaic and Mount Berenice – the Anchor Church.</p>\r\n<p>Capernaum – the first of the three cities of the "evangelical triangle" (including Bethsaida and Korazim) to return from historical oblivion, with Byzantine and Roman remains of a synagogue, a church and dwellings that raise many interesting questions and illustrate New Testament stories.</p>\r\n<p>Bethsaida – excavations are underway of the Roman city that figured centrally in the ministry of Jesus, and of huge remains of the biblical city of Geshur, hometown of David's wife Maacah (2 Sam. 3:3).</p>\r\n<p>Korazim National Park – an early Talmudic-era synagogue that is interesting to compare to Capernaum's, with the replica of its original Moses Seat, a ritual bath, dwellings and other elements that bring alive Talmudic descriptions of community life.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 8</h3>\r\n<p>From Dan to the Golan.</p>\r\n<p>Dan Nature Reserve – one of the finest examples of a biblical city and the capital of the Northern Kingdom, Dan's "Abraham Gate" (Gen. 14:14) is the second-oldest arch in the world. Also visit the Israelite gateway and the High Place of Jeroboam in their tranquil Dan River setting.</p>\r\n<p>Katzrin – a Talmudic-era Golan Heights village, Katzrin's reconstructed house and synagogue create a three-dimensional perspective on ancient life.</p>\r\n<p>Gamla Nature Reserve – called "the Massada of the north" because of Josephus' description of its famous last stand, a hike leads to Gamla, which boasts remains of the earliest synagogue ever found, ramparts that held back the Romans, and olive presses that were the town's livelihood.</p>\r\n<p>Umm el-Qanatir – a Talmudic-era town with unusual synagogue remains and unique finds, this site is now undergoing excavation using cutting-edge techniques and technology.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 9</h3>\r\n<p>From the Negev to Eilat.</p>\r\n<p>Be'er-Sheba National Park – this city that Abraham founded (Gen. 21:31) marked the southern border of biblical Israel (1 Sam. 3:20). Beersheba also shows fascinating evidence of urban planning from the time of the Judean monarchy, a unique water system and other finds that, along with its biblical significance, have accorded Beersheba a place on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites​.</p>\r\n<p>Avdat National Park – an important stop on the Incense Route, and a World Heritage Site, Avdat's Nabatean temple, which was converted into a church, reveals a fabulous Negev panorama, while its wine-press reveals the inhabitants' uncanny skill at cultivating the desert and ancient private dwellings and tombs complete the picture.</p>\r\n<p>The Uvda Valley – containing over 150 prehistoric and early settlement sites, including the Nahal Asharun site and the Leopard Temple.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 10</h3>\r\n<p>Eilat, Timna Park and Northward.</p>\r\n<p>Eilat – best known for its contemporary attractions as Israel's Red Sea Riviera, Eilat and its environs also boast a selection of off-the-beaten track archaeological sites, among them: the Shahmon Site Bronze Age tumuli and temple; the Eilot eighth-century Early Islamic village and copper smelting site; the Wadi Tawachin grinding site (possibly for gold); the Samar Neolithic desert kites (ancient gazelle-hunting traps); the Dapit Nabatean and Roman caravansary; the Evrona eighth-century chain well and farmhouse and more.</p>\r\n<p>Timna Park – a geological and archaeological wonderland including an ancient copper-mine shaft; Solomon's Pillars – a natural formation featuring a carving of the goddess Hathor and Hathor's shrine; the chariot carving and the multimedia presentation "The Mines of Time" and even an artificial lake.</p>\r\n<p>Head north on road 90 via the Late Roman Fortress at Yotvata, and then via road 13 to Makhtesh Ramon, seeing Roman milestones and the Nabatean caravansary at Ein Saharonim, or via the dramatic Scorpion Ascent (on road 227) following an ancient Roman route across the Negev to the Great Makhtesh and Mamshit National Park, a well-preserved Nabatean city along the UNESCO World Heritage List Incense Route, including a market, a bathhouse, early churches, mosaics and more.</p>",

The city is flat, small in size, and rich in content. ​</p>\r\n<p>Tel Aviv is a classic city for commuting by bike. <br /> Thousands of the city residents use no other form of transportation. The city is flat, small in size, and rich in content. There is something interesting to see on every street corner of this city that never stops. The following route is only a suggested guideline of where to go and not an outline of everything that can be seen on the way, for it would be impossible for us to list all the colors, smells, people, art, shows, museums and life that make up this wonderful city. <br /> A large number of the city streets have bike lanes which we recommend using, but some streets do not. Do not forget a helmet and lock when riding around town.</p>\r\n<p>Start your day by Riding South on the Seafront (Herbert Samuel Blvd). This will take you along the public beaches of the city into the old city of Jaffa. Ride into the Port, and there leave your bike to explore the alleys and churches of ancient Jaffa. Ride out of the port heading to the Jaffa Flea Market, where you can find nearly anything from clothing and toys to jewelry, art, souvenirs, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Head north out of Jaffa, crossing the bridge at Abarbanel Street into Neve Tsedek - the first neighborhood built out of Jaffa and in the "new" city of Tel Aviv back in 1887 – where it all began. Ride through the tranquil and colorful streets of the area, enjoy the public art and galleries, and stop into one of the fashionable cafes located everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Head towards the Shalom Tower and join the bike lane along Rothschild Blvd. Follow the bike lane through the heart of the \"Wh​ite City\" and observe the architecture that claimed this area a UNESCO world heritage site. You will arrive at the Bima Theater and the Dizengoff Center; the commercial heart of Tel Aviv.</p>\r\n<p>Follow the side streets parallel to Dizengoff, and then head east towards the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. After Visiting the Museum, stay on the inner streets, parallel to Iben Gvriol, going north to the Medina Plaza (Kikar Ha'Medina). Take some time to explore the fashion and boutique stores and the park situated in this high class area.</p>\r\n<p>Continue north, until you reach the park on the south shore of the Yarkon river. Ride along the peaceful bike lane towards the sea that will eventually bring you to the port of Tel Aviv. Follow the many bike routes of this historical location before heading back to the beachfront, where we started off.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your visit by heading straight to Jaffa, the picturesque ancient port from which Jonah set sail before being swallowed by the whale, where King Solomon imported the cedars of Lebanon to build the Temple in Jerusalem, and where Peter had his vision at Simon the Tanner's home.</p>\r\n<p>Don't miss the visitor center in Kedumim Square that showcases the history of the city and is built around antiquities from the time of Jesus. Enjoy a beautiful view of modern Tel Aviv from Jaffa, before driving through the city.</p>\r\n<p>Tour Tel Aviv's White City to see the preservation of buildings of Bauhaus architecture (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) including Independence Hall, where Ben-Gurion declared independence in 1948.</p>\r\n<p>Sheinkin Street is famous for its fun shopping, dining and people-watching in a youthful atmosphere, while the open-air Carmel fruit and vegetable market is a treat for all the senses. On Tuesdays and Fridays, the Nahalat Binyamin pedestrian mall comes alive with stalls selling handicrafts of every type.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Tel Aviv or Netanya area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Drive north across the Sharon Plain to the excavations of the ancient city and port at Caesarea National Park. King Herod built Caesarea in honor of his patron Emperor Augustus in the mid-first century BCE, and Pontius Pilate ruled the country from here.</p>\r\n<p>Peter's story, which you began to explore in Jaffa, continues here when he baptized Cornelius the Centurion in Caesarea. It was from this port that Paul set sail to preach in communities all over the Mediterranean, where he was later imprisoned for two years and appeared before Felix, Festus and King Agrippa. All these events are reflected in the ruins you'll tour, including the Roman theater, the hippodrome and Herod's palace, as well as mosaics and other remains from the centuries when Caesarea was an important Christian center, and the Crusader walls, moat and gates.</p>\r\n<p>Drive through the Ara Valley to Tel Megiddo, the Armageddon of Revelations 16:16. Tour the remains of one of the most intensively inhabited sites in the country with over 25 levels of settlement, spanning some 3,000 years, including walls, gates, palaces and dwellings from the time of King Solomon, King Ahab and the Assyrians. A highlight will be your walk through the water system, one of the great engineering marvels of antiquity.</p>\r\n<p>Cross the Jezreel Valley, sometimes called "the battlefield of the Bible" and now Israel's breadbasket, to Mt. Tabor to hear the account of the prophetess Deborah gathering her forces here in the time of the Judges to battle against Sisera. Jesus came to Tabor with Peter and James, was transfigured before them, and met with Moses and Elijah. After a breathtaking view of the valley below, visit the beautiful two-level Church of the Transfiguration.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Nazareth to visit Nazareth Village, a full-scale reconstruction of life in Nazareth during the time of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the centuries-old Church of St. Gabriel, which houses the village spring – one of the few authentic remains of the time of Jesus to be seen in Nazareth.</p>\r\n<p>Drive across the Galilee Mountains via Cana, the scene of Jesus' first miracle of changing water into wine, and home of Nathanael.</p>\r\n<p>Stop for a breathtaking overview of the Sea of Galilee and the scenes of Jesus' Galilee ministry that you will be visiting over the next few days from the Arbel Cliff.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Sea of Galilee area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your day at Kibbutz Ginosar to see the magnificent display of the wooden Galilee Boat, dating from the time of Jesus, which was discovered, mired in the mud on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Continue from Ginosar with a boat-ride across the Sea of Galilee, stopping for devotions as the waves lap quietly around the boat, recalling ancient times.</p>\r\n<p>Land near Capernaum to visit the ruins of this village, often called the hometown of Jesus, with its synagogue, church marking the home of Peter, and dwellings from the time of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>Next, stop at the nearby Chapel of the Primacy of Peter, where Jesus appeared to the Apostles after the resurrection, where you can go right down to the water's edge in beautiful surroundings. Nearby is the site of the miracle of the loaves and fishes at Tabha, with its famed mosaic depicting the two fishes and the five loaves Jesus multiplied.</p>\r\n<p>Continue north to the Mount of Beatitudes, the hill where Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount to the multitudes that stood below, with a beautiful view of the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon, visit Tel Dan, one of the most important biblical mounds in the country. Here archaeologists discovered an inscription with the words "House of David," and you can see a gateway from the time of Abraham, as well as the High Place of Jeroboam and the Israelite gate.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Caesarea Philippi, now known as Banias. Open your Bible among the ruins of pagan temples to consider the words Jesus spoke here: "Who do people say the Son of Man is?" (Matt. 16:13). As at Dan, you'll also enjoy the natural beauty of Banias nestled on the flourishing banks of one the Jordan's main tributaries.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Sea of Galilee area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Today you're heading up to Jerusalem! But before you leave the Sea of Galilee area, begin the day with an inspiring visit to Yardenit, the baptismal site located at the Jordan River on the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Driving south along the Jordan Valley your next stop will be the ancient city of Beit She'an. On the walls of this once-powerful city that controlled the gateway to the land of Israel the Philistines hung the bodies of Saul and his three sons, whom they had defeated in battle on nearby Mount Gilboa. You can climb to the top of the huge mound of biblical antiquities, and see many magnificent remnants of this city that was the capital of the Decapolis cities where the Gospels say the fame of Jesus spread during his public ministry.</p>\r\n<p>Continue down the Jordan Valley, seeing Jericho, and the Mountains of Ammon and Moab in Jordan, as you ascend through the Judean Desert to the Holy City.</p>\r\n<p>Before heading to your hotel in Jerusalem, stop for your first moving view of the Holy City from Mount Scopus, and open your Bibles to read "Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem (Psalm 122:2) and others of the Psalms of Ascent.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 5</h3>\r\n<p>Welcome the day with one of the most magnificent views in the world: ancient Jerusalem as seen from the top of the Mount of Olives. Allow some time to visit the various churches on the summit, among them: Pater Noster, where the prayer "Our Father" is inscribed in dozens of languages, and the Church of Ascension, marking the place where Jesus ascended to Heaven.</p>\r\n<p>Take the "Palm Sunday Walk" down the Mount of Olives in the footsteps of Jesus. On the way, stop at Dominus Flevit Church (The Lord Wept), marking the site of Jesus' weeping over the city (Luke 19: 37-42). At the Garden of Gethsemane at the base of the mountain, you can spend time pondering and praying about the time Jesus spent here with his disciples before his arrest.</p>\r\n<p>Enter the Old City via Lion's Gate, also known as St. Stephen's Gate to the Pools of Bethesda, where Jesus healed a paralytic (John 5: 2-9). Christian groups love to raise their voices in song at the adjacent Church of St. Anne.</p>\r\n<p>Walking up through the Old City streets, your next stop can be the Sisters of Zion Convent, built over the Praetorium, where Jesus was judged by Pontius Pilate and took up the cross, marked by the Ecce Homo ("Here is the Man" - John 19:5) Arch over the street. This site marks the beginning of the Via Dolorosa, the Way of Sorrows, which tradition says Jesus went with the cross to Calvary. Today, it passes through the colorful Old City markets to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. This is the site venerated by the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox world as the place of crucifixion, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>The day will end with a visit to the Garden Tomb. Located 500 meters to the north of Damascus Gate, this ancient cemetery discovered approximately 130 years ago by the British General Charles Gordon has become a moving site in which to recall the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, and spend time in these peaceful garden surroundings in prayer, song, fellowship and communion.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 6</h3>\r\n<p>Start the day with a visit to Yad Vashem the Holocaust memorial, with its astounding new historical museum, Hall of Remembrance, Children's' Memorial and other moving sites.</p>\r\n<p>Proceed to Ein Karem. This picturesque village is full of winding lanes, enchanting architectural features and lush green gardens. There are seven monasteries and convents inspired by various traditions at Ein Karem. It is said that John the Baptist was born here and that Mary drank from the Spring of the Virgin, still bubbling from a cave at an abandoned mosque near the center of the village.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the Israel Museum, home to the most important archaeological discovery of the 20th century – the Dead Sea Scrolls. An impressive model of Jerusalem in 69 CE sets the stage before entering the special shrine that contains the Scrolls. Stop at the square opposite the Knesset, to view Israel's legislature and see the magnificent bronze menorah with its carvings depicting the biblical history of Israel and Zechariah's immortal words "Not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit..." (4:6).</p>\r\n<p>Finish the day with a visit to downtown Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda and Nahalat Shiva pedestrian malls and meet Jerusalemites over a cup of coffee or a local dish at a cafe or restaurant, or stroll the open-air fruit and vegetable market, Mahane Yehuda. (Ask at your hotel about optional evening tours).</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 7</h3>\r\n<p>Head east out of Jerusalem through the Judean Desert to visit Qumran, where the famed Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Modern scholarship places a community of Essenes at this site, and it is possible that John the Baptist spent some time with the community here.</p>\r\n<p>Drive along the shore of the Dead Sea, to the oasis at Ein Gedi, where David hid from King Saul, and you can hike to a desert waterfall.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon, take the cable-car to the top of Massada, scene of the epic stand by Jewish rebels at the end of the great revolt against Rome nearly 2,000 years ago. The new museum at the visitor's center reveals the secrets of the daily life of the rebels, the story of the excavations, and how the site became one of Israel's most important symbols.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy a healthful and relaxing dip in the Dead Sea, the lowest, saltiest body of water on earth, before returning to Jerusalem.</p>",

בתיירים. לאחר כ-2 דקות הליכה, נפנה בפניה הראשונה שמאלה לרחוב הנוצרים אשר מהווה חלק מהשוק. לאחר כ-5 דקות הליכה איטית ברחוב הנוצרים נגיע לרחוב היורד ימינה – רחוב סנט הלנה שיוביל אותנו ישירות אל חזית כנסיית הקבר, אחת הכנסיות החשובות ביותר לרוב העולם הנוצרי המערבי והמזרחי. כנסייה זו מוקדשת לצליבת האדון ולקבורתו עד שקם לתחיה ועלה לאחר מכן השמימה. יוצאי דופן הם האבנגלים שבחרו להכיר באתר קבורת ישו ב\"\"גן הקבר\"\" הנמצא מצפון לשער שכם.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">כנסייה זו בסיסה בתקופה הרומית אך בניתה ככנסייה קשור לראשית התקופה הביזאנטית ולהלני הקדושה, אימו של הקיסר קונסטנטין. יש להתרשם מרחבת הכניסה, מהכניסה המרשימה וניתן לערוך ביקור במקום בלבוש צנוע והולם. המקום מורכב וסבוך ולכן הביקור צריך להיות ממוקד: מהכניסה מולנו אבן המשיחה, מימין עליה לגולגותא – מקום הצליבה, בהמשך ירידה ימינה לקפלת מציאת הצלב, עולים חזרה להמשך הקפת המבנה הרווי בסמלים ובקפלות. מגיעים אל מתחם הקבר שם לרוב, תור ארוך שך הצליינים הנוצרים.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">לאחר התרשמות מן המקום, נמשיך ליציאה מן הרחבה, כדקה הליכה עד לרחוב המוריסטאן מימין. השם שומר על שם קדום המורה על כך שבימי הביניים היה כאן בית חולים לצליינים.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נפנה ימינה ומצד שמאל לנו נראה כניסה לכנסייה של הלותראנים – \"\"כנסיית הגואל\"\" הבנויה על שרידי כנסיה צלבנית מן המאה ה-12. באם פתוח, ניתן לבקר בכנסיה, וכן לבקר בחפירה ארכיאולוגית קטנה, במוזיאון קטן וכן לעלות בגרם מדרגות לוליני וצר למגדל תצפית על העיר (לבוש צנוע, באתר הסברים באנגלית, בתשלום). אם יהיה לכם מזל תוכלו להכנס למבנה הצמוד ל\"\"כנסיית הגואל\"\" ל\"\"קלויסטר הצלבני\"\"- חצר סגורה ושקטה, סביבה חדרי ארוח, חדרי התכנסות וכנסייה קטנה, אחת משכיות החמדה של ירושלים.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">נלך לאורך רחוב המוריסטאן עד שנמצא עצמנו חזרה ברחוה השוק- רחוב דוד, נרד לאורכו כ 2 דקות ונפנה ימינה אל רחוב הקארדו הנמצא באתרו כלומר: על רחוב הקארדו מן התקופה הביזאנטית, מאות 5-6 לספירה. נהנה מאופי הרחוב, מכך שכמו בעבר הוא רחוב עם חנויות וסחורות ולבעלי הענין יש לאורך הרחוב מספר הצצות אל שרידי חומות מימי הבית הראשון והשני, שרידים שנחשפו בחפירות ארכיאולוגיות לאחר מלחמת ששת הימים, בהובלת פרופ' נחמן אביגד. לקראת סופו הסברים וציורים הקשורים לתקופה הביזאנטית והעתק של ירושלים במפת מידבא מן התקופה הביזאנטית, מפה שנמצאה בעבר הירדן המזרחי במדבא, ובה נראה רחוב זה עליו אנו הולכים היום, רחוב שנבנה לפני למעלה מ-1400 שנה. נעלה בגרם מדרגות ונמצא עצמנו ברובע היהודי ברחוב היהודים. ניתן לעשות הפסקה קלה להתרעננות באחד מבתי הקפה או המסעדות. נמשיך מספר צעדים לכיכר רחבה – \"\"כיכר החורבה\"\"ממנה נוכל להתרשם מבחוץ מהמבנה המפואר של בית הכנסת החורבה, ע\"\"ש רבי יהודה החסיד, ששוחזר ושוקם לפני מספר שנים. בסמוך רחוב תפארת ישראל עימו נמשיך דקות בודדות עד לרחוב משגב לדך. נמשיך שמאלה כ-2 דקות עד לרחוב התמיד שנמצא מימיננו, נרד עימו מרחק קצר עד לכניסה למבנה של \"\"ישיבת אש התורה\"\", מכאן תצפית מדהימה בעיקר מזרחה לעבר רחבת הר הבית, המבנים המוסלמיים שהוקמו עלי בתקופה הערבית הקדומה, בעיקר: מסגד אל אקצה וכפת הסלע המוזהבת. מכאן תצפית מצוינת לעבר הכותל המערבי ולעבר החפירות הסמוכות לכותל המערבי, לעיר דוד, להר המשחה, הר הזיתים והר הצופים (לבוש צנוע, הכניסה לישיבת אש התורה כרוכה בתשלום). נמשיך במעלות רבי יהודה הלוי לכיוון הכותל המערבי (לבוש צנוע). הכותל המערבי הוא שריד לחומת בית המקדש מימי הבית השני, שריד לחורבן הבית שהיה ב-70 לספירה והוא המקום הקדוש ביותר לעם היהודי. לאחר שהייה ותפילה למעוניינים, או הטמנת פתק של בקשה ותפילה, נצא מן הרחבה. נוכל לחזור לשער יפו בתחבורה ציבורית הנמצאת ביציאה מן הרחבה או לחזור ברגל במספר דרכים, מהלך 20 דקות עד חצי שעה דרך הרובע היהודי, השוק או שער ציון והליכה דרך רחוב הפטריארכיה הארמנית או מחוץ לחומות.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">שימו לב : לאורך המסלול שפע אתרים היסטוריים, ארכיאולוגיים, דתיים ומוזיאונים. רובם בתשלום. להנאתכם בחרו את האתרים המתאימים לכם. לחלקם נדרש תאום כניסה מראש.</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction: rtl;\">כתבה: רותי פרבולוצקי, משרד התיירות</p>\r\n<p style=\"direction:

            "FullDescription": "<p>Thousands of years of history come alive: peel off the layers, learn about ancient civilizations and experience Israel through its rich archaeology.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem: Views from Above and Below.</p>\r\n<p>Overview of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives: <br />This spiritually significant mountain is also the place for a bird's-eye view of Jerusalem's topography and for understanding how it grew through the ages.</p>\r\n<p>Underground Jerusalem including:<br /> The Western Wall Tunnel – the original Western Wall of Herod's Temple Mountover which Jerusalem of later eras was constructed, walking along 1,445 feet of the original, enormous 2,000-year-old Herodian stones, seeing the lofty Warren's Gate, a street and other finds, and a fascinating interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre – most of the complex over the sacred ground marking the tomb of Jesus is a complicated combination of medieval and Byzantine architecture. Deep below the surface are remains going back to a First Temple-era stone quarry and the world-famous and rarely viewed "ship inscription," probably carved by a long-ago pilgrim.</p>\r\n<p>The City of David – King David's "fortress of Zion" (2. Sam. 5:7), the ongoing excavations include a royal palace, Warren's Shaft, the "water fortress" of the Gihon (1 Kings 1:33), the Second Temple-era Pool of Siloam (John 9:7) and a 2,000-year-old street that once led up to the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Jerusalem Archaeological Park and Davidson Visitor Center – a "still-life" of the original Herodian street, revealing Roman destruction, Robinson's Arch, the Southern Wall and steps to Hulda's Gates; and the Davidson Center, in the basement of an eighth-century-CE palace with its virtual-reconstruction, high-definition interactive model.</p>\r\n<p>The Tower of David Museum – located at the Jaffa Gate inside the rooms of Jerusalem's Turkish citadel, abutting the huge tower which despite its name was constructed by Jerusalem's master-builder, Herod. Each of the many rooms features exhibits devoted to a different time-period, clarifying the capital's complex history.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Jerusalem: The Jewish Quarter and Museum Treasures.</p>\r\n<p>The Jewish Quarter, including:<br /> Hezekiah's Wall – part of the First Temple-era city wall built over Jerusalem's homes (Isa. 22:10) to protect the city against Assyrian invaders, and which finally fell to the Babylonians.</p>\r\n<p>The Cardo - Jerusalem's main street in the Byzantine and medieval eras, its colonnades and arched chambers now restored as a commercial center and archaeological display.</p>\r\n<p>The Herodian Mansions – restored as a living museum beneath contemporary buildings, with remnants of the fine homes, mosaics, implements of daily life and architecture of the city's wealthy class before the destruction of the Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Burnt House – the basement of a Jerusalem home revealing dramatic evidence of the Katros family who probably lived and worked here, and of Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. An audiovisual presentation offers a powerful version of the family's story.</p>\r\n<p>The Israel Museum – the museum's Archaeology Wing displays rare and world-famous finds from pre-historic times to the Byzantine/Talmudic era; the Shrine of the Book, houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest copies of the Old Testament ever found and the famed 1:50 Model of Second Temple Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Bible Lands Museum – a unique collection of ancient treasures mirroring the powerful cultures of Bible days including the Egyptians, the Hittites, the Philistines the Assyrians and others who left their mark on the region and in Scripture.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>From the Mediterranean Coast to Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Caesarea National Park – "Queen of the Coast" – Herod's showcase city, including the amphitheater; the theater; Byzantine walls; the "bird mosaic"; the Crusader city, the aqueduct and more.</p>\r\n<p>Megiddo National Park – King Solomon's regional capital (1 Kings 9:15), Megiddo's fortifications, water system, palaces, stables and dwellings spanning thousands of years and its great biblical significance have made it a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<p>Beit She'arim National Park – Talmudic-era catacombs with huge, decorated stone sarcophagi, where sages and leaders from across the ancient world were laid to rest, are just part of the fascinating antiquities of this city, one of the places where the Sanhedrin had its headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>Acre – this medieval gem on the Mediterranean retains a 900-year-old urban plan. The capital of the Crusaders after the fall of Jerusalem, Acre's ramparts overlooking the sea, its Knights Halls, fishermen's port, Turkish Bath Museum, bazaar and mosque over a gigantic medieval water cistern have all contributed to this city's selection as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Around the Sea of Galilee and north to the Golan.</p>\r\n<p>Tiberias - The present-day capital of the Sea of Galilee, built by Herod Antipas and once the headquarters of the Sanhedrin, ancient Tiberias is now undergoing excavation that will one day reveal in all their glory its market streets, colonnades, theater and more treasures. Visit the dig, as well as Hamat Tiberias National Park– the remains of a magnificent synagogue mosaic and Mount Berenice – the Anchor Church.</p>\r\n<p>Capernaum – the first of the three cities of the "evangelical triangle" (including Bethsaida and Korazim) to return from historical oblivion, with Byzantine and Roman remains of a synagogue, a church and dwellings that raise many interesting questions and illustrate New Testament stories.</p>\r\n<p>Bethsaida – excavations are underway of the Roman city that figured centrally in the ministry of Jesus, and of huge remains of the biblical city of Geshur, hometown of David's wife Maacah (2 Sam. 3:3).</p>\r\n<p>Dan Nature Reserve – one of the finest examples of a biblical city and the capital of the Northern Kingdom, Dan's "Abraham Gate" (Gen. 14:14) is the second-oldest arch in the world. Also visit the Israelite gateway and the High Place of Jeroboam in their tranquil Dan River setting.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<p>Haifa is a unique place within the Israeli urban landscape. A city sitting on the edge of a mountain, with the Carmel woods on one end and the Mediterranean beaches on the other. <br /><br />Haifa is a proud city of Muslims, Jews and Christians coexisting side by side, and is also the world center of the Baha'i faith. Cycling can be easy or hard, depending on your direction. The following route starts at the top of Mt. Carmel and slowly goes down toward the sea, but those of you who seek more of a challenge can cycle up in the other direction.</p>\r\n<p>Begin the day in Daliat El Carmel; the largest Druze community in Israel. Dalia (as locals call it) has a large open air market and many restaurants offering Druze and Arab cuisine. <br /> Follow the road along the Carmel, leading to Haifa. You will pass the tall tower of Haifa University, where the Hecht Archeology Museum is located. From there, descend along "Aba Hushi" road, named after Haifa's first mayor. Pass the Horev Center to Kababir neighborhood to pay a visit to the Saydna Machmud Mosque overlooking the sea, and continue to the Carmel Center. There are a few attractions to be seen here. Lock your bike and stroll down to the Haifa Zoo, the Katz Museum of Art, and the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art; all next to a wide assortment of shops, cafes, and restaurants. <br /> Follow the Yafe Nof Road leading to the Baha'i Gardens and World Center. Then follow HaTsionut Road to the Mausoleum of Bab Alla, founder of the Baha'i faith. These gardens are not only stuning, but they adorn the city of Haifa in an unforgettable way.</p>\r\n<p>After leaving the Baha'i Gardens, keep following HaTsionut to Hillel Street. From here, enter Hadar, what used to be the heart of old Haifa and today attracts many young people. Cruise the narrow winding streets, lined with stone buildings from the 1920's. Continue down Balfur street to the National Museum of Scie​nce Technology and Space located in the former building of the Technion. Nearby you will also find the Haifa Theater at the end of Phebzner Street. Further down Balfur street, you will reach the busy Hertzel Street, filled with clothing and shoe stores, just above the Shuk; Haifa's fruit and vegetable market.</p>\r\n<p>Follow Hertzel to the top of Wadi Nisnas. Get off your bike and devote some time to visit this unique neighborhood. Here, where Jews and Arabs share the same street, there is an annual festival celebrating the holidays of the three major faiths. The streets are decorated with public art that are renewed once a year. Wadi Nisnas also has a small, yet colorful market, and a wide assortment of food stands.</p>\r\n<p>After Wadi Nis Nas, take HaGefen street to the German Colony. Originally built by German Templers in the turn of the last century, the colony's magnificent buildings house today galleries &amp; restaurants and offer a pleasant atmosphere. Continue on HaGefen street to Kiryat Eliezer. Cross the busy highway and follow the signs to Bat Galim, a secluded beach neighborhood originally erected in the 1930's. Wide shady boulevards still stand here, leading to the beachfront and boardwalk. Finish the Ride by following the small road along the beach south. This road will take you past the marine research center and along all the sandy beaches of Haifa.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<p>This route will take you from the central Negev area through the plains of​ Judea and on to Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>day 1</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Mitspe Ramon to Azuz-Be'erotaim. </strong><br />Approx 80</p>\r\n<p>Leave Mitspe Ramon heading north on road #40 until you reach the turn to road #171 westbound. Follow this road across the Nitsana and Ellot dry riverbeds for 25 km until you reach road #10 going along the Israeli-Egyptian border. A hard climb awaits you after the turn, across Mt. Harusha. From there the road goes down and straight overlooking the Sinai desert on one side and the Negev on the other.</p>\r\n<p>Continue north for 36 km until you reach a dirt road to the ecological village in Ezuz. The place is named for the two nearby wells, named after Aaron and Moses, and has a combination of modern and ancient techniques of desert living. The two large wells here have attracted desert dwellers along the years and you can find several ancient farms and Bedouin places of gathering. Also nearby, Mt Harif has several prehistoric wall paintings.</p>\r\n<h3>day 2</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Azuz to Kadesh Barne'a. </strong><br />Approx 35 Km.</p>\r\n<p>From Ezuz, head north along the old train track. The track was laid here in the Ottoman period, as a preparation for the First World War. Stop into what remains of the old Turkish train station and army camp from the same time, before you enter the Nitsana preservation area. Here you will find reconstructed Nabatean agriculture and some ruins of the large town that stood here on the Incense Routefrom the Arabian Peninsula to Gaza and Rome. Further north you will cross the "Peace Path"; a large scale work of art set here in the name of peace between Israel and Egypt.</p>\r\n<p>You will soon reach Nitsana, an educational village founded by the Jewish Agency which focuses on Zionist and environmental education. From there, head back to road #10 and then north to Kadesh Barne'a, named after the site where the children of Israel slept on their journey with Moses. This is also the southern boundary of the sand plains of Agur and Halutsa, a ride through the dune area is a good way to end this short day before heading back for overnight in Kadesh Barne'a.</p>\r\n<h3>day 3</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Kadesh Barne'a to Dimona.</strong><br />Approx 80 Km</p>\r\n<p>"The southernmost towns of the tribe of Judah….Kinah, Dimona, Adadah…" (Joshua 15:21)</p>\r\n<p>Leave Kadesh Barne'a, and take road #211 west. This road passes by some large Nabatean sites and was probably a route of travel since man has crossed the desert.</p>\r\n<p>Pass Kibbutz Ashalim and continue until you reach road #40. Turn north, passing Kibbutz Tlalim and the nearby desert farms. Continue on road #40 until you reach the Negev Junction, then take road #224 towards Yeruham.</p>\r\n<p>Outside this small town, you will find the Yeruham well and ruins of a fort from King Solomon's Era. The well here, it is said, might be the well mentioned in the story of Hagar and Ishmael.</p>\r\n<p>From Yeruham, head north on road #204 until you reach the town of Dimona. This town was founded in the 1950s as part of a government project to house the hundreds of thousands of immigrants that came to Israel.</p>\r\n<h3>day 4</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Dimona to the Be'er Sheba valley.</strong><br />Approx 80 Km.</p>\r\n<p>"So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore oath there" ( Genesis 21:31)</p>\r\n<p>Take road #25 north of Dimona along the train tracks. Eleven km from here, you will reach the ruins of Aruar, mentioned in Deuteronomy. Archeological findings have shown a town from the days of King David, under the ruins of a Roman fort.</p>\r\n<p>From here, turn north on road #80 past the Bedouin town of Aruar to the Tel Arad junction. A few kilometers north of here, the tel itself is one of the oldest planed cities known in our region.</p>\r\n<p>Turn west on road 31 pass the Bedouin town of Csaife, to the Shoket junction. Turn north here on road #60 past Kramim and Meitar, and then head west on the service road heading to Kibbutz Lahav.</p>\r\n<p>The terrain will slowly change in this area, due to the fact that this is the northern border of the desert. In Lahav, you will find the ruins of the town of Tsaklag mentioned in Joshua and Samuel. Also here is a mu​seum commemorating the Bedouin way of life in the desert.</p>\r\n<h3>day 5</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Lahav to the Ella Valley. </strong><br />Approx 80 Km.</p>\r\n<p>"Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the philistines" (1 Samuel 17:2)</p>\r\n<p>Leave Lahav north, along the old patrol road past the Zaak and Moran archeological sites. The area north of here has been settled since before the days of exodus and therefore, you will see many ruins of ancient towns and villages as you continue north.</p>\r\n<p>Once you reach Shekef, turn west towards Amatsia and Lachish. Lachish, first mentioned in the book of Joshua, changed many hands over history. The national park does a good job illustrating the complex history of the place.</p>\r\n<p>From Lachish, head north on road #35 toward the ruins of Beit Guvrin. This is a town built in Hellenistic times of a people that lived mainly off of large quarries in the area. The town was destroyed by the Roman Empire around the turn of the first millennium. North of here, on road #38, is the Ella v​alley, where several important biblical stories took place; the battle of David and Goliath being the most famous of them.</p>\r\n<p>Continue on road #38, pass the Monastery of Beit Jimal, to Beit Shemesh, our last stop before Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>day 6</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Beit Shemesh to Jerusalem.</strong><br />Approx 40 Km.</p>\r\n<p>"….and in Jerusalem he reigned over all of Israel and Judah for thirty-three years"</p>\r\n<p>You might notice a great change of scenery in this area. The area north of Lachish is no longer the desert, and the closer you get to Jerusalem, the more mountains and hills you will see.</p>\r\n<p>Leave Beit Shemesh on road #3855 towards Bar Giora. At the end of this 12 km uphill ride, you will reach an outdoor café where local cyclists gather. The area is named after Simon Bar Giora who fought the Romans on these hills in the time of the great rebellion.</p>\r\n<p>From there, head down the hill and along the Sorek Valley on road #386. The road will take you past the monastery of John in the wilderness, to the Village of Ein Kerem. One last hill stands between you and Jerusalem which you will climb through the village of Ein Karem, the place where John the Baptist was born. Take some time to visit the several churches of the area, before completing the hill and arriving into the city of Jerusalem.</p>",

The reserve is 400 meters above sea level at its highest point and gently slopes down toward the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Upper Galilee.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Start the day with a visit to the Hula Valley Nature Reserve. The reserve has lovely walking trails, including a \"floating bridge\" over the wetland, and special lookout points where visitors can observe the avian wildlife. In the spring of 1994 another stage in the campaign to restore natural balance in the Hula Valley was completed: the re-flooding of 250 acres now known as Lake Agmon, located approximately two kilometers north of the Hula Nature Reserve. Visitors can visit the re-flooded area to appreciate nature's powers. <br /> While at the Hula Valley Nature Reserve don't forget to stop at Oforia, a fun multimedia display that tells the story of the migratory route across the region and the millions of birds that use it.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Mitspe Harashim, a small community nestled in the thick forest of Upper Galilee north of the city of Karmiel.

Like the Hula Valley in the north, the Arava is part of the land bridge linking Europe, Asia and Africa, which sees literally hundreds of millions of migrating birds each year. In the heart of it all, tiny Kibbutz Lotan has become recognized not only as hotspot for bird watching, but also a facility committed to the desert ecology, offering a diverse range of activities. Kibbutz Lotan also raises dairy cows, field crops and dates It is also home to Eco Fun, the Center for Creative Ecology, and a desert natural wellness center.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the Ovda Valley where desert scenery and the distance from the center guarantee detachment and rest from the hectic pace of life - in the southern Negev, where back-to-basics accommodations are available as a base for hikes in the region.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Eilat Region.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 9</h3>\r\n<p>Spend the day in the Eilat region snorkeling or scuba diving in the Gulf of Eilat, one of the most spectacular coral reefs in the world.</p>\r\n<p>A hike or drive up to Mount Tsefahot affords a view of three countries – Israel, Jordan and Egypt, are among one of many nature experiences in the area.

It is a phenomenon known as a Makhtesh: a huge crater developed by water erosion on top of a mountain ridge, creating a \"window\" onto the layers of rock from eons past. There are three makhteshim in Israel, which are the only formations of their kind in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Continue north along Route 40 and stop at Avdat, a city built by the Nabateans as a stop along the Incense Route they created from Petra to Gaza. The Nabateans learned to live in harmony with the desert by harvesting its meager rainfall to cultivate a host of crops. In making Avdat a World Heritage Site, UNESCO has recognized the unique contribution of the Nabateans to world culture.</p>\r\n<p>Stop to pay your respects at the tomb of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion with its magnificent view of the Wilderness of Tsin.

            "FullDescription": "<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your visit by heading straight to Jaffa, the picturesque ancient port from which Jonah set sail before being swallowed by the whale, where King Solomon imported the cedars of Lebanon to build the Temple in Jerusalem, and where Peter had his vision at Simon the Tanner's home.</p>\r\n<p>Don't miss the visitor center in Kedumim Square that showcases the history of the city and is built around antiquities from the time of Jesus. Enjoy a beautiful view of modern Tel Aviv from Jaffa, before driving through the city.</p>\r\n<p>Tour Tel Aviv's White City to see the preservation of buildings of Bauhaus architecture (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) including Independence Hall, where Ben-Gurion declared independence in 1948.</p>\r\n<p>Sheinkin Street is famous for its fun shopping, dining and people-watching in a youthful atmosphere, while the open-air Carmel fruit and vegetable market is a treat for all the senses. On Tuesdays and Fridays, the Nahalat Binyamin pedestrian mall comes alive with stalls selling handicrafts of every type.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Tel Aviv or Netanya area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Drive north across the Sharon Plain to the excavations of the ancient city and port at Caesarea National Park. King Herod built Caesarea in honor of his patron Emperor Augustus in the mid-first century BCE, and Pontius Pilate ruled the country from here.</p>\r\n<p>Peter's story, which you began to explore in Jaffa, continues here when he baptized Cornelius the Centurion in Caesarea. It was from this port that Paul set sail to preach in communities all over the Mediterranean, where he was later imprisoned for two years and appeared before Felix, Festus and King Agrippa. All these events are reflected in the ruins you'll tour, including the Roman theater, the hippodrome and Herod's palace, as well as mosaics and other remains from the centuries when Caesarea was an important Christian center, and the Crusader walls, moat and gates.</p>\r\n<p>Drive through the Ara Valley to Tel Megiddo, the Armageddon of Revelations 16:16. Tour the remains of one of the most intensively inhabited sites in the country with over 25 levels of settlement, spanning some 3,000 years, including walls, gates, palaces and dwellings from the time of King Solomon, King Ahab and the Assyrians. A highlight will be your walk through the water system, one of the great engineering marvels of antiquity.</p>\r\n<p>Cross the Jezreel Valley, sometimes called "the battlefield of the Bible" and now Israel's breadbasket, to Mt. Tabor to hear the account of the prophetess Deborah gathering her forces here in the time of the Judges to battle against Sisera. Jesus came to Tabor with Peter and James, was transfigured before them, and met with Moses and Elijah. After a breathtaking view of the valley below, visit the beautiful two-level Church of the Transfiguration.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Nazareth to visit Nazareth Village, a full-scale reconstruction of life in Nazareth during the time of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the centuries-old Church of St. Gabriel, which houses the village spring – one of the few authentic remains of the time of Jesus to be seen in Nazareth.</p>\r\n<p>Drive across the Galilee Mountains via Cana, the scene of Jesus' first miracle of changing water into wine, and home of Nathanael.</p>\r\n<p>Stop for a breathtaking overview of the Sea of Galilee and the scenes of Jesus' Galilee ministry that you will be visiting over the next few days from the Arbel Cliff.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Sea of Galilee area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your day at Kibbutz Ginosar to see the magnificent display of the wooden Galilee Boat, dating from the time of Jesus, which was discovered, mired in the mud on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Continue from Ginosar with a boat-ride across the Sea of Galilee, stopping for devotions as the waves lap quietly around the boat, recalling ancient times.</p>\r\n<p>Landing near Capernaum, begin to follow in the footsteps of Jesus' ministry in the villages around the Sea of Galilee. This area is known as the "Evangelical Triangle" since most of Jesus' miracles and teachings occurred around here. Capernaum, often called the hometown of Jesus, with its synagogue, church marking the home of Peter, and dwellings from the time of Jesus is one of its "points."</p>\r\n<p>Crossing the Jordan River north of the lake, continue east to Bethsaida, another point on the Evangelical Triangle, where a street from the time of Jesus and a fisherman's house are among the highlights, as well as massive walls from the biblical city of Geshur.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you are on the east side of the Sea of Galilee, continue to Kursi, the traditional place where Jesus healed the demon-possessed men by casting their evil spirits into a herd of pigs, with the remains of the largest Byzantine monastic complex.</p>\r\n<p>Then, head west, passing Capernaum again, to stop at the Chapel of the Primacy of Peter, where Jesus appeared to the Apostles after the resurrection, and where you can go right down to the water's edge in beautiful surroundings. Nearby is the site of the miracle of the loaves and fishes at Tabha, with its famed mosaic depicting the two fishes and the five loaves Jesus multiplied.</p>\r\n<p>Now, it's on to the third and last point on the Evangelical Triangle, Korazim, where you can see a synagogue with a ritual bath and an excavated public square.</p>\r\n<p>End the day at the nearby Mount of Beatitudes, the hill where Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount to the multitudes that stood below, with a beautiful view of the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Tiberias area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Ascend the Golan Heights today, the biblical Bashan and ancestral home of the half-tribe of Manassah and in Jesus' day, part of the territory of Herod Philip. Stop for an overview of Gamla, also known as "Massada of the north" where you'll hear a heroic story of the few against the many, as the raptors that are protected here soar overhead in these magnificent natural surroundings.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Katsrin and visit its ancient Talmudic Village to understand aspects of daily life at the time of Jesus as they are reflected in Gospel stories.</p>\r\n<p>Drive along Israel's border with Syria and stop at the Kuneitra overlook.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Kibbutz El-Rom to attend the audio-visual presentation that tells the story of the battle at the nearby "Vale of Tears" where a few Israeli tanks fended off waves of Syrian forces during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Following the presentation descend from the Golan to the Hula Valley via the Druze villages.</p>\r\n<p>Visit Tel Dan, one of the most important biblical mounds in the country. Here archaeologists discovered an inscription with the words "House of David," and you can see a gateway from the time of Abraham, as well as the High Place of Jeroboam and the Israelite gate.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Caesarea Philippi, now known as Banias. Open your Bible among the ruins of pagan temples to consider the words Jesus spoke here: "Who do people say the Son of Man is?" (Matt. 16:13). As at Dan, you'll also enjoy the natural beauty of Banias nestled on the flourishing banks of one the Jordan's main tributaries.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Sea of Galilee area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 5</h3>\r\n<p>Today you're heading up to Jerusalem! But before you leave the Sea of Galilee area, begin the day with an inspiring visit to Yardenit, the baptismal site located at the Jordan River on the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Driving south along the Jordan Valley your next stop will be the ancient city of Beit She'an. On the walls of this once-powerful city that controlled the gateway to the land of Israel the Philistines hung the bodies of Saul and his three sons, whom they had defeated in battle on nearby Mount Gilboa. You can climb to the top of the huge mound of biblical antiquities, and see many magnificent remnants of this city that was the capital of the Decapolis cities where the Gospels say the fame of Jesus spread during his public ministry.</p>\r\n<p>Continue down the Jordan Valley, seeing Jericho, and the Mountains of Ammon and Moab in Jordan, as you ascend through the Judean Desert to the Holy City.</p>\r\n<p>Before heading to your hotel in Jerusalem, stop for your first moving view of the Holy City from Mount Scopus, and open your Bibles to read "Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem (Psalm 122:2) and others of the Psalms of Ascent.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 6</h3>\r\n<p>Welcome the day with one of the most magnificent views in the world: ancient Jerusalem as seen from the top of the Mount of Olives. Allow some time to visit the various churches on the summit, among them: Pater Noster, where the prayer "Our Father" is inscribed in dozens of languages, and the Church of Ascension, marking the place where Jesus ascended to Heaven.</p>\r\n<p>Take the "Palm Sunday Walk" down the Mount of Olives in the footsteps of Jesus. On the way, stop at Dominus Flevit Church (The Lord Wept), marking the site of Jesus' weeping over the city (Luke 19: 37-42). At the Garden of Gethsemane at the base of the mountain, you can spend time pondering and praying about the time Jesus spent here with his disciples before his arrest.</p>\r\n<p>Enter the Old City via Lion's Gate, also known as St. Stephen's Gate to the Pools of Bethesda, where Jesus healed a paralytic (John 5: 2-9). Christian groups love to raise their voices in song at the adjacent Church of St. Anne.</p>\r\n<p>Walking up through the Old City streets, your next stop can be the Sisters of Zion Convent, built over the Praetorium, where Jesus was judged by Pontius Pilate and took up the cross, marked by the Ecce Homo ("Here is the Man" - John 19:5) Arch over the street. This site marks the beginning of the Via Dolorosa, the Way of Sorrows, which tradition says Jesus went with the cross to Calvary. Today, it passes through the colorful Old City markets to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. This is the site venerated by the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox world as the place of crucifixion, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>The day will end with a visit to the Garden Tomb. Located 500 meters to the north of Damascus Gate, this ancient cemetery discovered approximately 130 years ago by the British General Charles Gordon has become a moving site in which to recall the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, and spend time in these peaceful garden surroundings in prayer, song, fellowship and communion.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 7</h3>\r\n<p>Start the day with a visit to Mt. Zion and its many sites, among them: King David's Tomb and the Room of the Last Supper.</p>\r\n<p>Enter the Old City via Zion Gate and stroll through the alleyways of the Jewish Quarter, overflowing with historic sites and archaeological treasures. Stop at the Western Wall, the last remnant of the Herodian Temple Mount destroyed by the Romans nearly 2,000 years ago. While at the Western Wall, arrange your schedule to join a public tour of the Western Wall Tunnels by enquiring at the Western Wall Heritage Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>Explore the Southern Wall Archaeological Park located around the southwestern corner of Temple Mount. Here you can stand on the very street that Jesus would have walked 2,000 years ago and view other archaeological remains that shed light on other New Testament events. You can also visit the magnificent Davidson Visitors Center in the basement of an eighth-century-CE palace. Look into the possibility of seeing its virtual-reconstruction, high-definition interactive model, and enjoy the high-definition film open to all visitors that depicts ancient pilgrimage to the Temple in a unique way.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the most ancient part of Jerusalem: the City of David. This area has been excavated more than any other place in Jerusalem in the past 120 years and boasts some of the most important discoveries in biblical archaeology to date.</p>\r\n<p>End the day with a walk through the water of Hezekiah's Tunnel, named after the king who ordered it hewn to keep Jerusalem's water from the Assyrians when the city was under siege. A highlight of this visit is a stop at the Pool of Siloam, where new excavations have uncovered the actual remains of the pool where Jesus healed a blind man.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 8</h3>\r\n<p>Start the day with a visit to Yad Vashem the Holocaust memorial, with its astounding new historical museum, Hall of Remembrance, Children's' Memorial and other moving sites.</p>\r\n<p>Proceed to Ein Karem. This picturesque village is full of winding lanes, enchanting architectural features and lush green gardens. There are seven monasteries and convents inspired by various traditions at Ein Karem. It is said that John the Baptist was born here and that Mary drank from the Spring of the Virgin, still bubbling from a cave at an abandoned mosque near the center of the village.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the Israel Museum, home to the most important archaeological discovery of the 20th century – the Dead Sea Scrolls. An impressive model of Jerusalem in 69 CE sets the stage before entering the special shrine that contains the Scrolls. Stop at the square opposite the Knesset, to view Israel's legislature and see the magnificent bronze menorah with its carvings depicting the biblical history of Israel and Zechariah's immortal words "Not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit..." (4:6).</p>\r\n<p>Finish the day with a visit to downtown Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda and Nahalat Shiva pedestrian malls and meet Jerusalemites over a cup of coffee or a local dish at a cafe or restaurant, or stroll the open-air fruit and vegetable market, Mahane Yehuda. (Ask at your hotel about optional evening tours).</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 9</h3>\r\n<p>Head east out of Jerusalem through the Judean Desert to visit Qumran, where the famed Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Modern scholarship places a community of Essenes at this site, and it is possible that John the Baptist spent some time with the community here.</p>\r\n<p>Drive along the shore of the Dead Sea, to the oasis at Ein Gedi, where David hid from King Saul, and you can hike to a desert waterfall.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon, take the cable-car to the top of Massada, scene of the epic stand by Jewish rebels at the end of the great revolt against Rome nearly 2,000 years ago. The new museum at the visitor's center reveals the secrets of the daily life of the rebels, the story of the excavations, and how the site became one of Israel's most important symbols.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy a healthful and relaxing dip in the Dead Sea, the lowest, saltiest body of water on earth, before returning to Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 10</h3>\r\n<p>Drive west to the Valley of Ayalon, where Joshua called on the Lord to make the moon stand still. Stop at Emmaus on the road to which Jesus appeared to two of his disciples when they left Jerusalem after his crucifixion.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the Valley of Elah, where David fought Goliath. Drive up Tel Azekah to enjoy the fine overview of the famous battleground.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to Beit Guvrin National Park and Tel Maresha, the Israelite/Idumean town of Maresha – believed to be the birthplace of King Herod. Visit the underground network of man-made caves and see the Roman amphitheater.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon, visit the Neot Kedumim Biblical Landscape Reserve where the flora of the Scripture comes alive, along with biblical tools and industrial implements: oil presses, wine presses, cisterns and more.</p>\r\n<p>A stop at the Mini Israel theme park, with over 400 precise scale models of sites and monuments throughout the country, is a fun and interesting way to end your day and your Israel experience.</p>",

            "FullDescription": "<h3>Day 1</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your Jerusalem experience with one of the most magnificent views in the world: ancient Jerusalem as seen from the top of the Mount of Olives. Allow some time to visit the various churches on the summit, among them: Pater Noster, where the prayer "Our Father" is inscribed in dozens of languages, and the Church of Ascension, marking the place where Jesus ascended to Heaven.</p>\r\n<p>Take the "Palm Sunday Walk" down the Mount of Olives in the footsteps of Jesus. On the way, stop atDominus Flevit Church (The Lord Wept), marking the site of Jesus' weeping over the city (Luke 19: 37-42). At the Garden of Gethsemane at the base of the mountain, you can spend time pondering and praying about the time Jesus spent here with his disciples before his arrest.</p>\r\n<p>Enter the Old City via Lion's Gate, also known as St. Stephen's Gate to the Pools of Bethesda, where Jesus healed a paralytic (John 5: 2-9). Christian groups love to raise their voices in song at the adjacent Church of St. Anne.</p>\r\n<p>Walking up through the Old City streets, your next stop can be the Sisters of Zion Convent, built over the Praetorium, where Jesus was judged by Pontius Pilate and took up the cross, marked by the Ecce Homo ("Here is the Man" - John 19:5) Arch over the street. This site marks the beginning of the Via Dolorosa, the Way of Sorrows, which tradition says Jesus went with the cross to Calvary. Today, it passes through the colorful Old City markets to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This is the site venerated by the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox world as the place of crucifixion, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>The day will end with a visit to the Garden Tomb. Located 500 meters to the north of Damascus Gate, this ancient cemetery discovered approximately 130 years ago by the British General Charles Gordon has become a moving site in which to recall the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, and spend time in these peaceful garden surroundings in prayer, song, fellowship and communion.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\r\n<p>Head east out of Jerusalem through the Judean Desert to visit Qumran, where the famed Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Modern scholarship places a community of Essenes at this site, and it is possible that John the Baptist spent some time with the community here.</p>\r\n<p>Drive along the shore of the Dead Sea, to the oasis at Ein Gedi, where David hid from King Saul, and you can hike to a desert waterfall.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon, take the cable-car to the top of Massada, scene of the epic stand by Jewish rebels at the end of the great revolt against Rome nearly 2,000 years ago. The new museum at the visitor's center reveals the secrets of the daily life of the rebels, the story of the excavations, and how the site became one of Israel's most important symbols.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy a healthful and relaxing dip in the Dead Sea, the lowest, saltiest body of water on earth, before returning to Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in Jerusalem.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 3</h3>\r\n<p>Head down to the Coastal Plain today past the Ayalon Valley, where Joshua called the moon to stand still during battle with the Canaanites. Stop in Jaffa, the picturesque ancient port from which Jonah set sail before being swallowed by the whale, where King Solomon imported the cedars of Lebanon to build the Temple in Jerusalem, and where Peter had his vision at Simon the Tanner's home. Don't miss the visitor center in Kedumim Square that showcases the history of the city and is built around antiquities from the time of Jesus. Enjoy a beautiful view of modern Tel Aviv from Jaffa, before driving through the city and continuing north.</p>\r\n<p>Continue across the Sharon Plain to the excavations of the ancient city and port at Caesarea National Park. King Herod built Caesarea in honor of his patron Emperor Augustus in the mid-first century BCE, and Pontius Pilate ruled the country from here.</p>\r\n<p>Peter's story, which you began to explore in Jaffa, continues here when he baptized Cornelius the Centurion in Caesarea. It was from this port that Paul set sail to preach in communities all over the Mediterranean, where he was later imprisoned for two years and appeared before Felix, Festus and King Agrippa. All these events are reflected in the ruins you'll tour, including the Roman theater, the hippodrome and Herod's palace, as well as mosaics and other remains from the centuries when Caesarea was an important Christian center, and the Crusader walls, moat and gates.</p>\r\n<p>Drive through the Ara Valley to Tel Megiddo, the Armageddon of Revelations 16:16. Tour the remains of one of the most intensively inhabited sites in the country with over 25 levels of settlement, spanning some 3,000 years, including walls, gates, palaces and dwellings from the time of King Solomon, King Ahab and the Assyrians. A highlight will be your walk through the water system, one of the great engineering marvels of antiquity. Take in the breathtaking view of the Jezreel Valley, sometimes called "the battlefield of the Bible."</p>\r\n<p>Cross the Jezreel Valley past Mt. Tabor scene of the battle of Deborah and Barak against Sisera of Hazor and Endor, where Samuel appeared to Saul, and continue to the Sea of Galilee and the Tiberias area.</p>\r\n<p>Overnight in the Tiberias area.</p>\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n<p>Begin your day at Yardenit, the baptismal site located at the Jordan River on the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee. Continue with a boat-ride across the Sea of Galilee, stopping for devotions as the waves lap quietly around the boat, recalling ancient times.</p>\r\n<p>Landing near Capernaum, begin to follow in the footsteps of Jesus' ministry in the villages around the Sea of Galilee, visiting the ruins of this village often called the hometown of Jesus, with its synagogue, church marking the home of Peter, and dwellings from the time of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>Continue to the Mount of Beatitudes, the hill where Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount to the multitudes that stood below, with a beautiful view of the Sea of Galilee.</p>\r\n<p>Stop at Kibbutz Ginosar, Kibbutz Ginosar to see the magnificent display of the wooden Galilee Boat, from the time of Jesus. Leaving the lakeside, drive through Cana, scene of Jesus' first miracle changing water into wine at the wedding, and on to Nazareth, the boyhood home of Jesus.</p>\r\n<p>Visit the centuries-old Church of St. Gabriel, which houses the village spring – one of Nazareth's few authentic remains of the time of Jesus and enjoy a walk through the colorful market.</p>\r\n<p>Crossing the Jezreel Valley again, head back to central Israel via the foothills of Mount Carmel.</p>",
